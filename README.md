# Requirements
This code was made with **python version 3.10**. I haven't tested it with any other versions.

This code was made to run on a computer with **CUDA version >= 12.8**.
It might work with other versions of CUDA but I haven't tested it and it requires to install the right [version of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
The code should also work on a computer with no GPU although it is not recommended.

The list of the required libraries is in the **requirements.txt** file and can be installed with : 
```shell
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
# THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
