White seems to have two weaknesses: first, a lack of willingness to attack, even with positional justification, which may stem from lack of experience and knowledge of basic attacking motifs. Second, a lack of understanding of the opening (few players have this understanding in OTB play; play postal chess and you will learn the ideas quickly or lose badly, quickly). It is suggested that White switch to the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on their positional awareness. Work on common tactical ideas and learn patterns. Perhaps one thing that will help in the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a ""change up"" style (something to pull out for fun or when scouted at a tournament). This will add spice (not to mention confusion) to the opponent's life. If you want to work on positional understanding, study the games of Karpov, who happens to be a creative attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have never studied his games.) Also read Silman's ""How to Reassess"" book, if you haven't already. When all else fails, I'm looking for new students!
