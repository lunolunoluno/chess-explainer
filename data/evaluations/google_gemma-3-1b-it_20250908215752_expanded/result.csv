Rc4 Qa5 Rxc8+ Kxc8 Qa7 Qc7. Now for a review: Black allowed White to capture the d-file. This was compounded by giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding d6. Black's weak points appear to be a lack of control of the central squares, a lack of understanding of pawn play, and (I suspect) an inability to understand the board position. Now for the good: somehow Black managed to maintain balance in a difficult position. Black came up with a creative attacking idea (29...c4) when needed. With a solid understanding of the position and creativity, Black will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus your game on the center. Attack the center with simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the center) games. Consider charting pawn structures in your games; you may do better in positions without center pawns. Explore more aggressive openings, especially gambits. While charting your games, pay careful attention to when you make errors. For instance, moves 16 and 24 could be marked as major errors. When you encounter your common problem moves, give yourself extra time to think and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will lead to fast improvement.
