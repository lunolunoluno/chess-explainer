The move 16...Be7 is a check, which prevents the knight from developing and allows the opponent to","Giving up the Bishop is a new concession that in effect looses the game. The Bishop was the only piece that was keeping the Black Rooks from invading your territory. One general idea is for the defender to trade off attacking pieces. However, that guideline is wrong in this situation. Principle: You must do what the position demands. Do not just follow general ideas or try to force your will on the position. You can still fight on after 24/\ Bf8. Bxe7 Rxe7 Bxc6 Qxc6 Rd6 Qc7 Rfd1 Kb8 R1d3 c4 R3d4 c3 b3 Rc8 A nating idea at this point is 31/\.Qa5. Black's move 31....Rc8 does not help. Rc4 Qa5 Rxc8+ Kxc8 Qa7 Qc7 Now for a review. Black allowed White to capture the d - file. This was complicated by giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding d6. Your weak points seem to be the lack of control of the central squares, lack of understanding pawn play, and (I suspect) the inability to understand the board position. Now for the good: somehow you managed to maintain your balance in a difficult position. You came up with a creative attacking idea (29/\.c4) when you needed it. With a solid understanding of the position and your creativity you will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus your game on the center. I'd suggest that you attack the center with simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the center) games. You may want to consider charting the pawn structures in your games. For instance, you may do better in positions without center pawns. I would suggest that you explore more aggressive openings - especially gambits. While you are charting your games give careful attention to when you make your errors. For instance in this game you could mark moves 16 and 24 as major errors. When you come up to your common problem moves, give yourself extra time to think through your move and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will bring fast improvement. Qa8+ resign",0.024077720404953783,0.6981132075471698,0.07692307692307693,0.37735849056603776,0.05666156202143951,0.8278742432594299
