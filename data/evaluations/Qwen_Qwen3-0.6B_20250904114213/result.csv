What","White could choose to play in the center, revolving around attacking the e-pawn and controlling the e-file, most likely starting with ideas like 9.Qe2. White could choose to play on the queenside (now that Black has played b6) because of the idea involved with 9.c5! (making Black's b7 Bishop look ridiculous) and Rc1, a strong idea with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the kingside, where Black's king remains open. Moves such as 9.Bd3 come to mind. d2 is a poor square for the Queen as she is not involved in any real plan and is exposed to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4, etc.). Passivity resembles this move. Black still has to deal with the somewhat distant threat of Bd3 followed by Ng5 with a fork on the h and e pawns. However, intending Ng5 so the Knight can be protected from the Queen at d2 is a poor reason to make the move. With correct play, Black could have pounced on this. It allows White to develop with tempo and subsequent pressure on the new isolated e-pawn. It's too big of a trade-off between all these cons and the one pro of more Bishop activity. 9...Nf6! was the indicated move. Bxc4. Here, it doesn't take a Garry Kasparov or Vishy Anand to see that White is well ahead in position. Space advantage, more piece mobility, a lead in development, attacking chances – the list could go on and on. White's main trump is the long diagonal and the d-file, but their use doesn't leave as good an impression as White's. In an inferior position, Black chooses the worst way possible to defend the pawn. 10...Qf6 would have been indicated. Ng5! Personally, I would have castled kingside first to increase pressure with Re1, but one can hardly call the current move an error. It is a game-losing blunder.
