Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a tactical shot. c3 is probably the only move that loses. White should have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development on you, you cannot afford to waste time chasing pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing to move the Bishop off the ""dangerous diagonal"" (the diagonal that bears down on your f2/f7 square). White is completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2: Development is more important than breathing! Chess is a war game where you must mobilize your troops; otherwise, you ensure an easy game for your opponent. Again, this is another computer-like mistake. Play more live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open files. The one that will seal your fate is the d-file. (Chess lesson #4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent combines two common patterns: Bxe4 (Pattern #1: The decoy, which had the added bite of creating extra possibilities on f2) and Pattern #2: Clearing the file. Both are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time in learning these basic patterns.

Here is an explanation on why the last move played was a mistake:",White's move Bd3 is a mistake because it loses a pawn to Black's attacking piece. The engine suggests 18. exf6 as a better alternative. The engine's best line is 18... dxe5 19. Qxf6+ Kg8 20. Rd3,"A common idea after the g and h pawns have vanished is to get a Rook to one of the files. The ""perfect"" move is to play 20.Rd3. After this, I don't think Black can defend themselves. For instance, Black has two moves that make sense: 20...Nh7 and 20...Qe7. On 20...Nh7, 21.Qh5 c5 22.Rh3 f5 23.Qe8+ Kg7 24.Qxe6 shatters Black's pawns and exposes Black to all sorts of interesting things. On 20...Qe7, 21.Rg3 puts Black in serious trouble. 21...Ng4 22.Rh3+ Nh6 23.Rxh6# or 21...Qf8 22.Bd3 e4 23.Rh3+ Nh7 24.Qh5 Qg7 25.Nxe4. Then there is 22...Nh7 23.Qxe5+ f6 24.Qxe6. From this point on, White's game begins to deteriorate. Black must have been very happy at this point. Qh6+ Kg8 Qg5+ Kf8 Qh6+ Ke7 Qg7 e4 Bc4 Qe5 Nb5 Bc7. Also working is 26...e3. Stronger is 26...Bd5 27.Be2 e3. g3. White's strength in this game is a strong positional feel that is rare in young players. White seems to have two weaknesses: first, a lack of willingness to attack, even with positional justification, which may stem from lack of experience and knowledge of basic attacking motifs. Second, a lack of understanding of the opening (few players have this understanding in OTB play; play postal chess and you will learn the ideas quickly or lose badly, quickly). It is suggested that White switch to the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on their positional awareness. Work on common tactical ideas and learn patterns. Perhaps one thing that will help in the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a ""change up"" style (something to pull out for fun or when scouted at a tournament). This will add spice (not to mention confusion) to the opponent's life. If you want to work on positional understanding, study the games of Karpov, who happens to be a creative attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have never studied his games.) Also read Silman's ""How to Reassess"" book, if you haven't already. When all else fails, I'm looking for new students!
