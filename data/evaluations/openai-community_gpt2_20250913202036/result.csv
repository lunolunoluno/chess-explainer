Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a tactical shot. c3 is probably the only move that loses. White should have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development on you, you cannot afford to waste time chasing pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing to move the Bishop off the ""dangerous diagonal"" (the diagonal that bears down on your f2/f7 square). White is completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2: Development is more important than breathing! Chess is a war game where you must mobilize your troops; otherwise, you ensure an easy game for your opponent. Again, this is another computer-like mistake. Play more live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open files. The one that will seal your fate is the d-file. (Chess lesson #4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent combines two common patterns: Bxe4 (Pattern #1: The decoy, which had the added bite of creating extra possibilities on f2) and Pattern #2: Clearing the file. Both are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time in learning these basic patterns.

While a general idea is for the defender to trade off attacking pieces, that guideline is incorrect in this situation. You must do what the position demands; do not just follow general ideas or force your will onto the position. You can still fight on after 24...Rf8. White's move 31...Rc8 does not help. Rc4 Qa5 Rxc8+ Kxc8 Qa7 Qc7. Now for a review: Black allowed White to capture the d-file. This was compounded by giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding d6. Black's weak points appear to be a lack of control of the central squares, a lack of understanding of pawn play, and (I suspect) an inability to understand the board position. Now for the good: somehow Black managed to maintain balance in a difficult position. Black came up with a creative attacking idea (29...c4) when needed. With a solid understanding of the position and creativity, Black will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus your game on the center. Attack the center with simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the center) games. Consider charting pawn structures in your games; you may do better in positions without center pawns. Explore more aggressive openings, especially gambits. While charting your games, pay careful attention to when you make errors. For instance, moves 16 and 24 could be marked as major errors. When you encounter your common problem moves, give yourself extra time to think and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will lead to fast improvement. Qa8+ resign.",0.07165810204823482,0.5094339622641509,0.038461538461538464,0.3584905660377358,0.04600662495399337,0.8197396397590637

The engine suggests,"White could choose to play in the center, revolving around attacking the e-pawn and controlling the e-file, most likely starting with ideas like 9.Qe2. White could choose to play on the queenside (now that Black has played b6) because of the idea involved with 9.c5! (making Black's b7 Bishop look ridiculous) and Rc1, a strong idea with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the kingside, where Black's king remains open. Moves such as 9.Bd3 come to mind. d2 is a poor square for the Queen as she is not involved in any real plan and is exposed to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4, etc.). Passivity resembles this move. Black still has to deal with the somewhat distant threat of Bd3 followed by Ng5 with a fork on the h and e pawns. However, intending Ng5 so the Knight can be protected from the Queen at d2 is a poor reason to make the move. With correct play, Black could have pounced on this. It allows White to develop with tempo and subsequent pressure on the new isolated e-pawn. It's too big of a trade-off between all these cons and the one pro of more Bishop activity. 9...Nf6! was the indicated move. Bxc4. Here, it doesn't take a Garry Kasparov or Vishy Anand to see that White is well ahead in position. Space advantage, more piece mobility, a lead in development, attacking chances – the list could go on and on. White's main trump is the long diagonal and the d-file, but their use doesn't leave as good an impression as White's. In an inferior position, Black chooses the worst way possible to defend the pawn. 10...Qf6 would have been indicated. Ng5!

Here is a concise explanation on why the last move played was a mistake:","This move is a mistake because it is a mistake because White's bishop is in a position that is weak. Instead of attacking the bishop, White could have attacked the knight, avoiding the danger of getting the rook into a position that would allow White to defend the queen. This move allows White to gain a tactical advantage.",This is an elementary tactical blunder. Black was focusing on Ne3xg2 (impossible due to the Qd2 hanging) and missed the rook move. Black should have played Nd3.,1.7997802579930302,0.15254237288135594,0.017241379310344827,0.1016949152542373,0.132890365448505,0.8606942892074585
