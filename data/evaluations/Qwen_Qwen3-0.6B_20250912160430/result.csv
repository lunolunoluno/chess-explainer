Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a tactical shot. c3 is probably the only move that loses. White should have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development on you, you cannot afford to waste time chasing pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing to move the Bishop off the ""dangerous diagonal"" (the diagonal that bears down on your f2/f7 square). White is completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2: Development is more important than breathing! Chess is a war game where you must mobilize your troops; otherwise, you ensure an easy game for your opponent. Again, this is another computer-like mistake. Play more live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open files. The one that will seal your fate is the d-file. (Chess lesson #4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent combines two common patterns: Bxe4 (Pattern #1: The decoy, which had the added bite of creating extra possibilities on f2) and Pattern #2: Clearing the file. Both are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time in learning these basic patterns.
