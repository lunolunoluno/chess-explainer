After all, I was not the first and not the tenth person to play the King's Indian. It was employed by Capablanca and the English Champion Yates, and it was played by Reti, Euwe, Chigorin and even Tarrasch. But it should be realised that this is a good position only compared with the Queen's Gambit, where you are down on your knees, awaiting the invasion of a knight at e5, the doubling of rooks, and so on.",True
