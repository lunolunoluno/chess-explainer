1. e4 c5,"I suppose it's ironic that Vallejo Pons should NOT play the Black side of a Spanish, Berlin Variation against Kasparov. Of all his opponents this one, who had such difficulty against that opening variation in his match with Kramnik, is the one he trusts will have something prepared, an improvement which might beat him.",True

He would sometimes play ...d7-d6, Nb8-d7 and sometimes ...Qd8-c7 with ...Nb8-c6. More recently GM Taimanov of Russia has employed this kind of opening flexibility. The 4...a6 line carries Paulsen's name and 4...Nc6 carries Taimanov's name.",True

Moving Qd8 off the file makes ...d7-d5 impossible. Not pinning Nc3 leaves Pe4 completely safe. I'd say it's usually not so terrific to play a Hedgehog formation, but against Kasparov it has to be bad; but that's what Black has to do now.",True

The bad side of this move isn't so obvious, but with experience in Maroczy Bind positions (such as this) the pawns are better at a2 & b2 or a2 & b3. Once there's a pawn at a3 the queen-side is weaker and Black will threaten Pc4 as much as he can. If then b2-b3 defends Pa3 will be weaker.",True
