1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Be7 4. h4,"This is definitely not the best move. 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.
Nxe5 wins a pawn with a great game for white. Among masters, this is usually
winning. The text move, however, doesn't develop a piece, weakens white's
kingside, and even concedes the g4 square to black. I honestly can't see how
this helps white. Piece development is critical...generally white would want
to get his bishop out, his queen knight out, castle short, and basically get
all white's pieces into the center to try to overwhelm black.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Be7 4. h4 Bg4 5. Be2,"Unnecessarily passive. More promising is 5. dxe5 Bxf3 (forced) 6. Qxf3 dxe5 7.
Bc4 Nf6 8. Be3 with a reasonable game for white.",True

compensation. 9. Nd2!, however is more active, and can help drive away black's
bishop with Nc4.",True

it's too vulnerable to attack by black's pieces. Instead, the best white may
have at this point is c3, to defend against the threat of ...Bxb2, plus deny
the central d4 square for the black pieces.",True

up the center when white's king is still uncastled, plus gives the d5 square
to use for black's pieces. At this point, white probably had to console
himself with 15. a3 Nc6 16 Qxb7, though black is certainly still better.",True

white's position is very difficult in any case. White cannot castle, and the
center's wide open, chances look bleak that white can repair his position.",True

pins (now the rook on b6 pins the bishop on b5) is rarely good, and this is no
exception. Black could have played 21 ... c6 and pretty much have forced white
to resign. Notice that 22. Nxf6+ Nxf6 doesn't go anywhere, since the bishop on
e5 would then be pinned.",True

actually playing better players is THE way to get better quickly. Failing that,
you could check out some chess books out of the local library, but books can
