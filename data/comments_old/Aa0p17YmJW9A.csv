1. d4,"Later in life, Najdorf took up the King's Indian with formidable effect. His games at Zurich in 1953, along with those of Gligoric, made a profound impression on Bobby Fischer. But this game was played in the early 1930's, before Najdorf had discovered the King's Indian. Here, he sets up a classic Stonewall Dutch -- a variation that was serving the up-and-coming Russian player Mikhail Botvinnik well at about the same time.",False
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6,This is the first decision point for Black. Some Russian players -- notably Korchnoi -- favored ...g6 and the fianchetto of the King's Bishop. That variation used to be called the Leningrad Dutch...But perhaps we'll have to call it the St. Petersburg Dutch now!,False
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6,"This is Black's second decision point. With ...b6 and ...Bb7, he can set up a sort of Queen's Indian formation in which he has a good grip on e4. But Najdorf goes with the classic Stonewall pawn formation, grabbing space and locking down on e4 but creating a rigid pawn formation that may block in his own pieces, particularly the B/c8.",False

For example: 9.cxd5 By capturing on d5 at the very moment that Black's N/d7 blocks off his B/c8, White can force Black to recapture with his c-pawn rather than the strategically desirable recapture with the e-pawn. 9...exd5 (9...cxd5 This recapture, though it does not lose a pawn, leaves Black with an unweildy block of pawns including the useless pawn on e6. Since White wishes to operate on the Queenside anyway, the open c-file is to his advantage.) 10.Bxf5 If Black captured with the e-pawn, he would be on his way toward freeing his B/c8 -- but alas, the f-pawn is momentarily undefended, so this is tactically untenable.",True

Ng5,"White, however, doesn't take advantage of his opportunity, and in letting it slip he also gives Black a free pawn. Najdorf now uses a familiar theme to take advantage of the undefended N/g5.
