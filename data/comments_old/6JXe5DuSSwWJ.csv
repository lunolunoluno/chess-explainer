levels and it is not easy for white to find a good plan. After studying a few
examples I decided to stick to the following plan: 1. Secure the king side
against atack. This is achieved by not allowing the exchange of the white
squared bishop (pawn at h3 and King at h2). 2. Fiancheto the black squared
bishop, push the a-pawn once so it is protected and the queens rook is free to
move (the a-line will sooner or later be opened after the exchange of the
b6-bishop). 3. Start active manoevers in the center (by preparing one of the
pawn pushes - d2-d4 or f2-f4). Open at least one line in the center, try to
take control over it and then prepare atack on either queens or kings side -
acording to the circumstances. It is difficult to say in how far this plan
would have been successful against a stronger oponent. In this game black
played without a clear plan and soon got in trouble.",False

move is rather unclear.",True

only imagine black wanted to double his rooks at the a-line but this is a
rather time consuming and - even if successfully finished - a rather dubious
idea. There are no good prospects for a play on the a-line for black.",True

knights are being exchanged and it becomes difficult for him to put a knight
at c5 it might be good to push b5 in order to control the white squares at the
queen side)",True

rs possible this one seems to me to be the worst. Black should have avoided
the opening of the center with all forces. Instead, he jumps into an open game
where the white pair of bishops soon brings him into serious trouble.",True

now move his central pawns with tempos and soon get a complete control over
the center. Obligatory was 21. ... Nf6, e. g.:",True
