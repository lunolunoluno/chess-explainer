1. Nf3,"Ivanchuk is an enigma. He's capable of some horrificly complicated tactical melees and of some brilliancies, but he's also capable of exceedingly odd play. He usually begins with 1. e4, but will play whatever suits his needs. Here he plays 1. Nf3, it's first occurrence of the tournament, and what kind of game does he desire? Who knows, perhaps not even him.",False
1. Nf3 c5,"Kasparov offers a transposition to a Sicilian Defense by 2. e4. But, Kasparov can also play many kinds of openings, so this might remain a closed position.",False
1. Nf3 c5 2. g3,"With Pc5 White won't get d2-d4 without having to consider ...cxd4. But, it could become an English Opening with c2-c4 or a King's Indian Attack with d2-d3 and e2-e4.",True
1. Nf3 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. O-O,"White waits to see how Black is organized before committing any pawns. But, does that gives Black time to make any White pawn move a bad one? With ...Nb8-c6 he makes d2-d4 impossible and c2-c4 weakens d4.",False
1. Nf3 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. O-O Nc6 5. c3,"This isn't so terrific. It's an indication Ivanchuk doesn't want to play a King's Indian Attack (5. d3) , but wants to fight Kasparov's pieces head-on. However, in this opening you can't always force such things without dire consequences. Nb1 won't be able to develop to c3 and Black is probably already equal.",True

His choice to exchange-off that pawn probably didn't take him long. It gives the c3 square back to White, so Nb1-c3 will be available. But, Black's Ng8 isn't required to develop to f6 to block Bg7 (as Nf3 does to Bg2) . It can develop Ng8-h6-f5 or with ...e7-e6, Ng8-e7 and Black's position will be very harmonious.",True

Rfd1 Rfd8 14. g4 Rac8 15. h3,"Both sides have developed sensibly, but now what? Bg2 isn't especially terrific, so White might think of e2-e4, but Black has aligned against Pd4 to prevent that.

Rdc1 Qe8 19. Ne1 Nf6 20. f4,"Ivanchuk beats Kasparov to the punch and makes his own king-side gesture. Of course there's no way to know, just yet, whether this could succeed or backfire.
