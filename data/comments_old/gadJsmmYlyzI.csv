1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5,"This position is known as the Center Counter, or Scandinavian defense. While
objectively sound for black, I don't recommend it as this early queen sortie,
as it doesn't help black's central control much, plus black always has to be
careful where he moves his queen again, as the monarch is always pushed around
by White with an eventual Nc3 or c4. If black isn't careful, he could lose his
queen easily, as this game demonstrates.",True
1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 Nc6,"A good move by black. He
gets his knight out, while at the same time puts pressure on White by
threatening to capture on d4.",True
1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 Nc6 4. Nf3 Nf6,"Natural, but inaccurate. An
aggressive ...Bg4! followed by castling queenside could really put the
pressure on White's center. For example, if ...Bg4 5. c4?? Qe4+ 6. Be2 Bxf3 7.
gxf3 Qxd4 leaves black up a pawn! This is one reason why it's common for white
to boot black's queen from the center as soon as possible by playing Nc3 move
2. As it stands, white gets a free hand to push black around.",True

to accept the fact his only reasonable posts for her is d6 or d8.",True

this, White has a won game, and you played well to convert it.",True

Instead Bb5, followed by Nbd2, Qa4 would really put the pressure on black.",True

Qa4 and/or Ne5 would make black resign soon.",True

for sure. There are many ways to win at this point.",True
