1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6,"This is a wasted move because the primary objective of the opening is
get your pieces to useful squares as soon as possible. Time can be a decisive,
depending on how you use it.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 4. c3,"The Giuoco Pianissimo. The idea is to
play a quiet controlled game. Unfortunately many underestimate the potential
of quiet moves and quiet games. This is fine if you understand the options and
what you are choosing. For instance 4.0-0 is strongest and 4.d4 is interesting.
Also playable is 4.Nc3 but this leads down some very sharp lines. I don't like
this move. It certainly develops a piece but it does not stop the intended 5.
d4. This gives White a target in the center, which means that time can be
gained by attacking the Bishop. d4 An interesting idea is 5.b4 but it is
generally wise to play in the center unless there is a specific reason. cxd4
Bb6 Again, Black does not help the cause in the center. /\Bb4+ is much
stronger and because it puts pressure on the White center (attacking a
supporting pieces with a pin). Also notice that the Bishop has moved twice and
is not necessarily useful at b6 in this position. b3 Fasinating idea. The
possibilities of playing Bb2 or Ba3 offer Black some potential headaches. I
personally like 7.0-0 because another primary idea of the opening is King
safety. Preparing to castle is one of those keys. Remember because you are
ready to castle does not mean you have to castle but all things being equal,
typically you will want to castle as soon as it is safely possible.",True
