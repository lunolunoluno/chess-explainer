1. d4 f5,"The Dutch defense is
becoming less and less used in masterplay due to evolving opening theory and
refuting ideas. Much stronger is the classic King/^s Indian with 1/\Nf6 or
Queen/^s Pawn game with 1/\d5.",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4,"Bb4+? Unnecessarily restrictive. The
simple 2/\Nf6 was called for or setting up the stonewall formationwith 2/\d5
with 3/\c6 to follow. TheStonewall is well-known as an (+)Anti-computer[+]
defense because the positionstend to be reliant on long term positional
maneuvering and not quick tacticalflares.. This allows white a free handin the
center to push to e4 and increase his spatial advantage and to openlines to
use his superior development. The text is easily refuted with 3. Nc3 where any
exchange on c3 can only benefit white. Bd2 Bxd2?! Not the best continuation
here either. Much more logical is 3/\Qe7, when 4. g3 Nf65. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 and
only now Bxd2 where black doesn/^t stand nearly as badly. The text
relinquishes Black/^scontrol of the center as well as speed in development.
Nxd2  A playable alternative",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6,"Another dubious move. Better is
4/\Nf6 5. e3 b6 6. Bd3 c5 7. 0-0 and then 7/\Nc6 when Blackdoesn/^t stand as
badly. Black isn/^tgiving White much to think about.",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4,"A good decis
ion. Tobe considered as stronger, however, is 5. g3 with a kingside
fianchettogradually building up the position. Attempts to retain the
initiative with 5. d5 Nce7 6. dxe6 dxe6 onlysucceed in helping black mobilize.
Opening the position early like this without the development to back it up can
lead to disaster. Nxe4",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4 d5,"The first blunder. The e-file was already white/
^s avenue of attack as long as the blackking is in the center. Weakening
thee-file for white even further does not help matters. Not only is the e-pawn
weak, but the king is weak! Much better was the obvious 7/\Nf6 with acastle
kingside. Nc5?! A questionable move. Certainly the knight cannot establish
himself here. It would seem as though this warrior wouldlike to fight on black/
^s weak side of the board, the kingside. 7. Ng3 would be begging to be played.
Now, Black can solidify with 7/\Nge7! 7/\Nge7 kept things together in
excellent order for blackwith the idea of 0-0 and Nf5 followed by Qd6
solidifying with chances. Also, eventual e5 advances would begin to become
feasible. There/^s no reason to immediately chase the knight away from its
post. Nb3 Bb7? A blunder. Black may feel obligated to play that move because
of b6, however it is imperative thathe castle as soon as possible. Therefore,
8/\Nge7! with the idea of 0-0 Nf5 and Nce7 would be indicatedfor Black.
Another possible move, evenmore aggressive perhaps, is 8/\Qf6!? threatening
Nge7 with even stronger forceas the ideas dxc4 followed by Nd5 are now
possible. After the text white can pick which side of the board to play
on(queenside, center, kingside) as he has prospects in each area.",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4 d5 4. Qd2,"White could choose to play in the center which would revolvearound attacking
the e-pawn and controlling the e-file most like starting withideas like 9. Qe2.
White could chooseto play on the queenside (now that black played b6) because
of the ideainvolved with 9. c5! (making the b7 bishop look pretty ridiculous)
and Rc1, a strongidea, with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the kingside where
black/^s king remains open. Moves such as 9. Bd3 come to mind. D2 is a poor
square for the queen as she is not involved inany real plan and she/^s exposed
to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4) etc. Passivity resembles this move. Black
still does have to deal with thesomewhat distant threat of Bd3 followed by Ng5
with a fork on the h and epawns. However, intending Ng5 so theknight can be
protected from the queen at d2 is a poor reason to play themove. With correct
play, Black could/^vepounced on this. Allows white to develop with tempo with
subsequent pressureon the new isolated e-pawn. It/^s toobig of a trade-off
between all these cons and the one and only pro of morebishop activity. 9/
\Nf6! was the indicatedmove. Bxc4 Here, it doesn/^t take a Garry Kasparov or
Vishy Anand to seethat white is well ahead in position. Space advantage, more
piece mobility, a lead in development, attackingchances, the list could go on
and on. The main trump black holds is the long diagonal and the d-file. But
use of these means doesn/^t leave as goodof impression as White/^s. In an
inferior position, Black picks the worst way possibleto defend the pawn. 10/
\Qf6 would/^vebeen indicated. Ng5! I personally would/^ve castled kingside
first to increasepressure with Re1 as well, but one can hardly call the text
an error. A game-losing blunder. If Black intended to sacrifice the isolated
e-pawn, he should/^ve done sowith 11/\Nf6. Now the position becomeswide open
and tactics loom left and right. Only the better developed, fully-mobilized
side can profit from this.",True
1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4 d5 4. Qd2 Na5,"bxa5 Nxe6 Bxe6 Bxe6 Qe7 d5?! Much superior
to the text is of course, 15. 0-0. Not bad at all. Thelong awaited Nf6!
However, here thecapture on e6 would/^ve been a stronger preparatory
combination to the text.",True
