white can get a slight pull by playing 8. cxd5 cxd5 9. Qb3 e6 (...Nb6 10. Ne5)

wrong. If white was planning this, he never should've posted his queen on c2,
because now the lady will be exposed for free tempos by black. Instead, a3 or
e4 are much more consistent...leaving white with a slight advantage (center,
black's less than ideal knight on b6).",True

about it. Instead Qd2 is stronger. This would prevent blacks' queen from
infiltrating b4, help insure white can contest the c-file (since the Q would
be covering c1), and indirectly hinders an e5 break by black (because the
black d-pawn would be hit by white's queen and bishop. Also, ...Bg4, followed
by ...Bxf3, gxf3 is not dangerous for white. Remember: a weakness is only a
weakness if it can be taken advantage of! This motif is seen often in

Qe2 Bg4 17. h3 Bxf3 18. Qxf3 e6 19. Rac1 Qb4 20. Qe2 Rc6 21. Rxc6,"? Now black mobilizes his pawns, white's bishop is bad, and will
activate black's bishop as well, not to mention undoubling black's pawns for
him. Because of the opposite colored bishops, white could put a much stiffer
reistance by playing 21. Qd3 Rfc8 22. Rcd1!, and black has no access points
(c2 is covered by the light squared bishop), and no way to boot white's bishop.
Note that even if black sac'd his rook on c4 at some point, white doesn't even
have to take it! Also, the d-line pressure would discourage a ...e5 break by
black. White would basically ""shuffle"", since black can't break through.",True

With this game, it's hard to answer your question about strength...white made
a number of positional errors, and black could be anywhere from an A-class
player to grandmaster. I need more games to make a better evaluation in that
regard. White played approx. B-player strength. Keep at it, and always go over
any losses/draws you experience, so you can learn and improve even more.",False
