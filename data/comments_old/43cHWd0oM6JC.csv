newspaper ""Niva"", with a curious introduction by Chigorin. He wrote:
""Sometimes may happen that a chess game is repeated from the first move to the
last one. It is possible when an unexperienced player in the opening play some
natural- and good-looking move. Indeed such moves drive him to a defeat. One

in amateur practice, and my opponent, an enthusiastic amateur has played it
four times against me."" Chigorin does not tell us if there was a fifth time
where his opponent, convinced by the previous four kicks, found the right
continuation. I think this player should be remembered as ""Knorr the
tenacious"".",True
