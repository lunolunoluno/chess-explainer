1. e4 c5,"Playing Adams in this tournament has been something akin to walking through a minefield. If Kasparov can get through unscathed he'll stay in the lead and get to the climactic matchup with Ponomariov in the next game. But, if he should lose he'll be the underdog in that big matchup. Adams or Shirov in the last round, could act as spoilers, but the fight is between Kasparov and Ponomariov.",False

Qf3, but I've never seen it played after 6. Be3. The idea is usually to allow O-O-O without having Qd2 blocking the d-file and to be able to meet ...e6-e5 with Nd4-f5 (and possibly ...g7-g6 with Nf5-e3, so putting Be3 seems odd. It's weakness is that it blocks Pf2 from immediately moving to f4, so that means Black can use square e5 or at least he doesn't have to worry much about e4-e5.",True

I think Adams would be happy to have another weakness he can play against, without having extended his own position; just so he doesn't lose Qf3 because of it's exposure.",True

The open f-file isn't so bad for Black. He could play ...f7-f6 in a pinch, but Pg4 is quite weak. One Black advantage which could easily be overlooked is that his king is centralized and would be better in an endgame (I think the current situation is too complicated to be called an endgame and neither king would feel safe playing offensively) .",True
