1. e4 Nc6 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d4 e5,"There was no reason take the free, central pawn at e4. If white tries
to threaten checkmate and black's knight with Qf3, then d5! stops the mate
threat and protects black's knight. Black would have the advantage.",True

unless you have a really good reason. Correct was to preserve your knight with
4. ... Ne7, with the idea of ...Ng6, ...Bc5, ...d6.",True

tactical motif is very common...watch for it.",True

position for black, but it's not time to throw away pieces yet. When in doubt,
improve your worst pieces. Black would like to get his a-rook into the game.
The best way to do that is ...Rd6, ...Qd7, and ...Rd8. If black can establish
dominance over the d file (column), then he'd have a slight advantage despite
having a worse pawn structure.",False

good reasons (like forced checkmate). Also, when in doubt in what to move,
improve your worst pieces. Masters do this themselves when a plan isn't
obvious. In addition, try to concentrate your heavy pieces (rooks & queen) on
open files (columns)...they are most effective in that setup. Try to look at
forced moves, and try ask yourself, ""Why did my opponent move there?"". If you
ask yourself that question, often you can see that he was trying to threaten
your pawns/pieces or checkmate, and if you see his threat, you can parry it.",True
