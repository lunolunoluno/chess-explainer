1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 dxe5,"4...Bg4, 4...g6, and 4...Nc6 are all more coomonly chosen, but this lane
leads to an interesting sacrifice of White's material I wished to examine.
This move was introduced into GM play by Larsen against Tal in the Candidates'
Semi-final, 4th game, 1965.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 dxe5 5. Nxe5 Nd7,"Larsen chose 5...e6 for the
sixth match game because after the fourth, he was of the opinion that Black
should not allow White the following sacrifice. Another common option is 5...
g6.",True

have examined this line in quite some detail.",False

was hoping to get the opportunity to show why.",True

making an escape hatch for Black's King. Other moves gives White an advantage.",True

1988 continued 9...c6 when White oplayed 10 Bh3+ and Black was okay, but White
could have played 10 axb5 which is evaluated unclear, but the opening of the
position looks very dangerous for Black im my opinion. I selected 9...b4 to
try to keep the lines closed around my King's upcoming home on the Queenside.",True

White alertly notices that c4 is now available for this Knight.",False

example, 10 Ncf6 allows White mate in three.",True

interest to take the perpetual check as well because Black is very close to
finding safe haven for his King, after which he should be able to consolidate
his piece up. Conclusion: if White intends to play for a win with the Modern
Variation, 4 Nf3, this game poses an important challange. White must then
continue with 8 c4 instead, when I believe Black can triumph. 8 g3 in turn
poses a challange for Black to avoid a draw if he wishes to. Then, Black must
play the dangerus looking 9...c6 since 9...b4 results in a draw.",True
