In that game Black played 13...Ba6 in order to provoke 14.b3, after which, he returned to base with 14...Bb7, with the intention of hindering the development of the White king's bishop.

In Inside Chess, Seirawan indicates 13...Rc6 as even better, with the variation 14.Qd4 Qa8 15.Be2 Rc5 16.f3 d5, with advantage for Black. Difficult as I find it to contradict the analysis of one of my seconds, I don't think this recommendation is very sound. 15.Bd3 is much better for White, who can then meet 15...Rc5 with 16.e4, which leaves the Black queen rather stranded on a8.",True

Black can still then try to use his major pieces to wrestle the initiative from his opponent during the middlegame, but there is little hope of a large advantage.
