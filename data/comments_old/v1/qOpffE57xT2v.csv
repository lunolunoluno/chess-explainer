1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6,Unlike the Dragon Variation the Accelerated Dragon allows White to play c2-c4 (Maroczy Bind) . This gives White a terrific grip on d5 and shortens Black's part of the open c-file. Black's trump is that White won't be castling queen-side and then launching the St. George's attack on the h-file at Black's king. Both sides usually castle king-side and fight it out all over the board.,True
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5,This is a little different. More common is Bf1-e2. After the game move Nd4 remains weak for a move or two longer.,True

Rc1 Rac8 13. f4,"With Qa5 it seemed obvious Black would try for ...Nc6-e5 to threaten Pc4, so f2-f4 takes that away. Curiously, as in the English Opening game against Shirov, Polgar is using her pawns quite a lot to restrain the opponent. Of course it's risky to move pawns too much and exposed pawns require some defense, but if the opponent isn't careful it can turn into a landslide where their pieces never become active and the pawns advance to create an offensive threat.",True

Kh1 Na5 16. e5,"White takes a shot at immediate activity to counter Black's on the c-file. Usually this wouldn't work, but there are instances (exceptions sort of) where it can work. In this case I'm wondering where Nf6 will go.",False

Nce3,"Polgar prefers to guard Pc2 and square b3, preventing ...Na5-b3, and keeping her queen-side coordination intact rather than grubbing a pawn with Bxh5. Of course, that may change quickly. Moving Nc2-e3 may just be part of a plan to maneuver everything toward Kg8.",True

Nce3 e6 19. Bxa5 Qxa5 20. Nc3 Qb6,White's position is looking a bit loose and it's just the stranded Nh5 which looks terribly awkward for Black.,True

It's one where Nh5 is still stranded, but White has made Nc4, Pe5 and Qd1 work together to restrain or even beat Black's central position! It's very difficult to find a good continuation for Black.",True

It took some nifty footwork in the middle-game to make the transition, but she did it nicely.",True
