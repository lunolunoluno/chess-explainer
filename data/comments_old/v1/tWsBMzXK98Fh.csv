1. d4 g6,"From what I've seen Morozevich prefers stable pawn structures and depends upon piece play. He might like a Benko Gambit or a Dutch Defense, but in this case he's trying to provoke Bareev into 2. e4, an opening system Bareev doesn't usually play. This position could easily transpose to many different things: Dutch Leningrad with ...f7-f5, Gruenfeld with c2-c4 ...d7-d5, King's Indian Defense with c2-c4 ...Ng8-f6 and others.",True

1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5,"This forces the game off into another direction. It's thematic for Black to fight on the dark squares, but White's setup is a little unusual. If White plays d4-d5 Black might play ...b7-b5; something he wouldn't ordinarily be able to do.",False
1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3,"White chooses to support his central pawn and to block Bg7, but at the cost of not having c3 available for a knight. Incidentally, Pc5 is now threatened.",True
