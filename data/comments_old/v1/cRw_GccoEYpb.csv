1. e4 c5,"First, I have to say this fellow's name is rather appropriate for chess. It looks to me like it would be prounced ""pawn-ovich"". But, of course, we also know pawns don't win games as much as pieces.",False

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O d6 7. c4,"Again, as in several other games of this tournament, Polgar uses another pawn to restrain her opponent's pieces. This one is recognized as fully appropriate for this position. I'd probably play the same. Black usually challenges Nd4 before this and that fact changes the course of the game to make c2-c4 impossible.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O d6 7. c4 b6 8. Nc3 Bb7,"What is White's plan? Often it's to play a ""normal"" way and to let Pc4 participate incidentally. The costs of having Pc4 is that it's impossible to pressure Pa6 with the Bd3 and Qd1-e2 and Bd3 is undefended.",True

If Pf4 advances then ...Nd7-e5 is terrific. However, if White can create a second threat to go along with f4-f5 then White can still make progress. If White does nothing immediate then Black might consider ...Nd7-c5 to pressure Pe4, but he has to be cognizant of the fact White might use b2-b4 at any moment to chase Nc5 away; so, timing is important. To that end people have often played ...Ra8-c8, ...Qd8-c7-b8-a8 to add more pressure to Pe4. The danger of that is to find Qa8 too far from the king-side to assist in any defensive measures.",False

Bf2,"I'm not certain where she thinks the bishop will be better placed, but it's difficult to marshall the forces better before making a committing move such as f4-f5.",True

Nb3,"This probably indicates she wants to move Bf2, but doesn't want to retreat Nd4-e2 where it would block Re1 from defending Pe4. This indicates the difficulty of trying to maintain a static position, rather than carrying out a dynamic plan leading to some positive action. And, after all, what is Nb3 doing? It might have participated in king-side play, but it doesn't seem likely now. Also, without Nd4 the dark-square diagonal is weaker and Bg7 better.",True

It's hard to criticize this move because it is done with good intentions, but Polgar's reply does make it appear to be a mistake. It's just terribly unobvious.",True

The better-formed queen-side pawns, if unblocked, are better. It's a curious thing also that there are times when a rook and knight work better together than a rook and bishop, so Black's Bg7 might be valued highly at the moment, but only a few moves from now the knight could be better!",True
