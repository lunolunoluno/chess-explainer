1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4,"This is more aggressive than 3. Nf3, but it also offers Black more choices for defense. Common responses are 3...c5, 3...e5 or 3...Nf6. All of them challenge White's central pawns immediately. There were a couple of these played in the FIDE wch match of Ivanchuk and Ponomariov. If White is allowed time to develop pieces to support his pawns then Black would have real problems. It's essential to know precisely what White's pawn formation is, so that Black's developments will be most effective. If White can keep his pawns as a duo they might advance in any fashion to foil Black's early developments.",True

Incidentally Pd4 isn't en prise because 6...Qxd4 is met decisively by 7. Bb5+.",True

It's often difficult to explain the rationale for such play. In this case Black can't get Bc8 developed as early as he'd like, so he uses Pf5 to control light squares. Black has to stake out control of the light squares to fix White's central pawns in place, then the assault on them would begin. This also explains why Black doesn't move ...Nb4-d5. He needs to leave open the possibility of ...c7-c5xd4, so control of d5 is sufficient; he doesn't have to occupy the square.",True

White doesn't continue with the central pawns now that he's gained a concession (king's weakness) from Black. Now piece play can become prevalent. White would probably like to play Qd1-h5+, but he can't afford to until he's hobbled Nb4. It threatens to jump into c2 if White walks away from that square.",True
