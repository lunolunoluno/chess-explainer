too early. Better would've been to prepare this move with Nd3, and possibly
even Kh2, g3, f4 so that way white can recapture f4 with a pawn and therefore
deprive the nice e5 square for black's pieces. As the game goes, white gets a

on the light squares. Much better for black would be 19. ... g6! 20. Qe2 Bd7,
