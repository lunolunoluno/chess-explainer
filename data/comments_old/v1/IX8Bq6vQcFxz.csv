1. d4 d5 2. Nf3,"This is a flexible move which might still be followed by c2-c4, but could also lead to a Torre System (Bc1-g5) or London System (Bc1-f4) or Colle depending upon Black's response.",False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6,"Is there much purpose to such a move or is he simply giving Ivanchuk something to think about, considering alternatives he might not have thought about during his pre-game preparations. Sometimes giving a person alternatives lets them go astray of their own accord.",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3,"Since Pd5 will oppose White's Bf1 White will probably try c2-c4, but Black could still support Pd5 with ...c7-c6 (and Anand has played the Semi-Slav Defense) .",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. c4,This can be effective to fight Pd5 because Black would be risking a lot to just play ...c7-c6 and hold on. Usually Black captures Pc4 and fights to activate his pieces with the belief White isn't so likely to play or be able to utilize e2-e4 because Bg2 would be blocked.,True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. c4 O-O,After this Black is conceivably threatening to take Pc4 and hold onto it.,False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. c4 O-O 6. Qc2 c5,"This is an attempt to show White hasn't put enough pressure on the center or developed quickly enough to avoid simplification. I wouldn't say this is a sharp attempt by Black to play for a win, though it is conceivable one would still win with the Black pieces. Pd5 is weaker than before, so cxd5 might loosen up Black's position a bit.",True

Rd6 Rac8,Black is steadfastly holding onto the pawn. White doesn't want to capture axb5 because he likes the alignment of Rd6 with Ba6; though opening the a-file at some point might be useful.,False

I also find it interesting that Ivanchuk didn't make any headway against Ponomariov's Queen's Gambit Accepted or against Anand with the Catalan, where the basic idea of Black threatening to take and hold onto Pc4 is primary and for Black to play strongly with his pieces while Bg2 is (at least temporarily) blocked by Nf3 seems to give Black easy equality.",True
