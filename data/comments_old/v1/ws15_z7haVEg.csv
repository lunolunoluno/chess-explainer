1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4,"This variation has a mixed reputation. On the one hand, Black concedes some space to White without much of a struggle, creating the pawn formation that Hans Kmoch would immortalize as the ""French Jump Formation."" On the other hand, Black's position resembles a brick: small, compact, hard to crack. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit fans are apt to play f3 here, counting on the materialistic nature of the average French player to make him munch the pawn.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4,"Najdorf just takes it off: he's interested in fluid development with a slight but pleasant spatial advantage without a material sacrifice. 
(4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3 Nf6 By transposition, then, we'd have the Euwe Defense to the BDG. The Euwe Defense has a pretty good theoretical reputation at present thanks to endorsements from GM Joe Gallagher and the Watson & Schiller analytical team. But it's not clear that this reputation is deserved since there are some improvements for White on the aforementioned analysis. In any event, what makes the 4.f3 line less attractive for White is the fact that Black can simply ignore it, like so: 4...e3 Now White has no open f-file, his f-pawn stunts his Kingside development, and the pawn formation is otherwise the same as he would get by just taking the pawn on e4.)",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7,"Partly because of the uncomfortable position of a Queen on f6, Black prepares the Knight exchange by playing Nbd7. Black would like to exchange off this strong N/e4, but the most natural way to do it can lead to trouble. 4...Nf6 Every time I give a simultaneous exhibition, I look to catch another victim in some version of the following age-old trap: 5.Nxf6+ Qxf6 6.Nf3 b6 7.Bd3 White weaves a nefarious web; Black plans a counter-blow. 7...Bb7 8.Bg5 Oh no! Is the Queen caught? 8...Bxf3 No she isn't! 9.Qd2 Yes she is!!! 9...Qxd4 No! 10.Bb5+ Yes!! Variants of this trap come up in many different openings. Whenever I teach the Colle System to a beginner, I make a point of illustrating how it can arise there -- and I have had more than one student come back and tell me tales of Queens netted like this!",True

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3,"How should we assess the position here? 
White's spatial advantage is worth the most when Black is cramped, with too many pieces on the board and too little space for maneuvering them. It makes good sense, therefore, for Black to swap off a pair of Knights. Makes sense -- but also takes time, and a single pair of Knights isn't all he'd like to get rid of. (6...Nxe4 7.Bxe4 Nf6 8.Bd3 After a tit-for-tat like this, Black is still left with a deficit in space and, importantly, a trapped B/c8.)",True

His pieces lack good squares and White is pretty obviously going to be coming down the d-file in the very near future. For example: 13.Be3 Bb7 14.Bxb7 Rxb7 15.Rd7 ...with Rad1 to come.

This is the most natural way to recapture -- yet it is precisely against this move that Najdorf's idea can be put into action. 
10.Bb5+! Kf8
Because of the combined force of Bishop and Knight covering c6 and d7, Black is obliged to forfeit castling now.Perhaps you're thinking, ""So what? The King looks pretty safe on f8."" But the point is that in the long run Black's position will be even less coordinated than it is now -- he would have real difficulties getting his pieces into action. Already one of the difficulties he faces from being cramped, he should really want to avoid it -- whether or not there are immediate tactical consequences.",True

But he reasons thus: why not take with the pawn and get rid of that pesky N/e5 once and for all? Now if White backs up the Knight, Black can play f5, Nf6, Qd7 and 0-0-0 -- he might even be able to use the g-file for an attack on White's King later on. Even ugly moves can give victory if they are not met resolutely. Fortunately for us, resolute play is Najdorf's strong suit!
Can you guess what he uncorks here?",True

For example: 11...Kg7 12.Bh6+ Kg8 13.Qg4+ Here's a delightful little line. 13...Kf7 14.Qg7+ Ke8 Now taking the Rook allows Black to play Nf8. Can you see a better idea? 15.Qg6+!! (15.Bg6+ hxg6 16.Qxg6#) 15...hxg6 16.Bxg6# Same effect, but a little more glamourous this way.",True

So we know, already, that White has at least a perpetual check in hand any time he wants it.Najdorf, of course, wants a good deal more than that.
