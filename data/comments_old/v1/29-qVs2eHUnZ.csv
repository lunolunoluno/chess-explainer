1. e4,"Hasting. August,5 - September,2 1895. A prestigious tournament,
organized in order to compare the playing strength of the top chess champions
at that time. Chigorin, Lasker, Tarrasch, Steinitz, Schlechter and other 17
players were participating. All of them were very strong players. Among them
Janowsky and a new talented american player Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who won
the tournament with 16.5 points out of 21. Janowsky, for various reasons not
at his best playing strength, was however successfull in defending his
reputation he had gained in Paris.",False
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7,"Steinitz, always faithful to his favoured defense, this time has
improved it with the move a7-a6.",True

to give his lightsquare Bishop for the sake of attack. Is that too much?
Pillsbury, categorically, commented: ""Such a move should cost the game to
White.""",True

exchange is a real mistake. A deadly mistake, I would say. After 9...Bxf5 10.
exf5 White would have lost a piece without compensation."" Is it possible that
both Janowsky and Steinitz overlooked the simple continuation suggested by
Pillsbury? Uhmm ... hard to believe.  And in fact, the moves 9... Bxf5 10.
exf5 c4 11. Nc3 (!)  cxb3 12. axb3  followed  by Rf1-e1 and Nc3-d5 (or Nc3-e4)
should make worry the Black's conductor. Let's say that his position, with the
King in the middle of the chessboard, half-undressed, seems at least unclear.
Open windows and doors create air currents which are dangerous for healt. If,
for instance, 12...Nxf5 then 13.Qd5 would win the piece back with advantage.
If then White would play at once 11.Re1, Black, before taking the Bishop,
should scratch his head and think about it one, two, ten times before doing it.
Maybe Pillsbury, with the presumption tha can be told from his words, did ""pee
counter wind"", to use an italian expression.",True

the dangerous lightsquare Bishop. Maybe, probably, surely indeed, Janowsky
will show us that his opponent ""fell out the frying pan into the fire""!",True
