1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 c5 3. dxc5,"This is the King's Indian transposing into the Krause variation of the
Grunfeld Reversed. c5 is an aggressive move attacking your center. Dxc5 is
playable if you get all your development done in quick fashion, but it's
generally not good to surrender the center. Much more aggressive and to the
point is c4 transposing into the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit
which is a much more aggressive attacking line for you undermining his center.
As occurred later in the game, he possessed powerful center pawns which he
could've used to his advantage if he chose.",True

development of his king knight to f6 giving his queen pawn strength with a
developing move and also taking command of your K4 square. Rather than the
text, you should've considered playing 4. Be3 with the idea of fianchettoing
your king bishop and retaining the extra pawn. Notice this will prevent
black's king bishop from taking control of that powerful diagonal that you
tried to get him off later in the game. After Bxc5, you played correctly by e3,
but life's not easy for you. You have what is known as a pawnless center,
meaning no pawns on the fourth rank. Your opponent's fifth move was a blunder.
He should've continued with the more logical Nf6 once again.",True
