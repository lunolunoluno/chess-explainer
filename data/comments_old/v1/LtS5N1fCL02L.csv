Akesson had never used this lunge, so to some extent it became a surprise for me, but, frankly speaking, rather pleasant one. Let me a little digression to explain to my readers what these feelings are bound up with. 
I studied chess at the Leningrad Pioneers' Palace (subscribers of the ""New in Chess"" Magazine could feel its atmosphere with the help of the remarkable essay of Genna Sosonko, dedicated to Vladimir Zak [""A great teacher inspires"" - see NIC 99/5]). A very experienced master Sergey Khavsky was my coach (by the way, a well-known St.Petersburg grandmaster Vladimir Epishin, living now in Germany, was one of his students). 
Well, master Khavsky inculcated us steadfast disgust for moves like g2-g4 and g7-g5, especially when one makes them at the open position or having a king unprovided for. He often said that ""the only case to play g2-g4 is when you win at least a piece"". We even invented a special term for such a move - ""the anti-Khavsky move"". Accordingly, when an opponent resorts to the move, I feel an insuperable desire to ""punish"" him for this untimely activity and permanently tell myself that ""a pawn doesn't advance back"" and that ""the position weakening must adversaly affect early or late"".",True

Bb2,"Had a pawn stayed on g2 instead of g5, the advantage of White would have been incontestable, for he has two bishops and a solid center. But now the weakening of the White's kingside gives Black objects for counterplay. That moment I thought kindly of master Khavsky once more.",True
