1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Bg4,"Black plays this move to exchange his Bishop for White Knight, breaking up White's King-side Pawns. However, after this exchange White will have an effective Pawn majority on the King-side against Black's ineffective one on the Queen-side. White can produce a passed Pawn in the resulting ending, while Black cannot force a passed Pawn with his Pawn majority on the other side. Black has a Bishop pair as a compensation for his Pawn weakness, which he can put to good use in open position.",True
