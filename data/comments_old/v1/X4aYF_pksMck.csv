1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5,"He mentions at this point that the French is the refutation to 1.e4,... and you might be wondering where the hell that statement could be coming from.  Well I would just like to point out that, in serious tournament games, he has played 1.e3 e5 2.d3 d5 3.d4 many times.",True

However, black's idea in the game should not be completely underestimated.  When one side has lots of space to maneuver it is typically thought that he has an ""easier position to play"" which is not true.  What is true is that he has an objective advantage because he can decide when to strike.  However, he has to make the decision over the board and this can be a very hard call to make.  If he strikes at the wrong moment he will free his opponent's pieces and hand over the advantage along with a complete psychological reversal.",True

(which he mentions), followed by Ke3, h4-h5 etc.  The move he played in the game is completely natural but it simply doesn't work.  This was hard enough to see in hindsight, and I envy the player that could see it at the board!",True

Qd3 Rdc8 34. b5,"I'm not so enthusiastic about this move.  In my opinion the position is roughly even now (the last great chance for white was 19.Kf2), and this is asking for trouble.  Of course such a move may be justified, for instance in time trouble when you need to produce a decisive result.  Even if it doesn't work and you become slightly worse, it may actually improve your winning chances by giving your opponent an obligation to avoid the draw!  Nonetheless, from the chess point of view white should avoid weakening himself.",True
