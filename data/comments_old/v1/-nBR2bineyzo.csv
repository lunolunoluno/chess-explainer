1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6,"French Defense, Classical Variation, He's hoping for e4-e5 to create a fixed blocked pawn structure where Black has ...c7-c5 to create queen-side play.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nbd7,"So, it transposes to a Rubinstein Variation after all. This has been quite popular among GMs in recent years, though Ponomariov beat Ivanchuk in the first game of their FIDE wch match. Black aims to not have any pawn weaknesses and to have a very secure king, hoping to trade minor pieces to achieve a draw. White has to fight piece on piece and be creative to force weaknesses in Black's position, so he can attack. To that end White has often, in recent years, aimed for Bf1-d3, Qd1-e2, O-O-O to bring the rook to the center quickly and to enable more free-wheeling king-side aggression.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nbd7 6. Nf3 Be7,Allowing Black to oppose both Ne4 and Bg5 seems to assure he will be able to trade several minor pieces to achieve the simplification he desires.,True

It helps in some cases to get rid of White's Pd4 to prevent White from having complete control of e5. It also limits Black's freedom to ...O-O-O and it takes a tempo away from piece development.,True

Black hasn't maintained his king's safety and that lead to him having to defend rather than developing Rh8 and Ra8. Although White is behind a rook it's the one he has on b3 which is more useful than both of Blacks! It also helps that his king is rock solid safe.,True
