1. Nf3,"He varies from 1. c4, perhaps because he thinks his opponents are now focusing on him and finding particular plans to defeat him, rather than taking him for granted. He might just be tired (for the moment) of his usual opening.",False
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4,"His move-order has prevented the 1. c4 e5 defense for Black. Now if Black wants ...e7-e5 he'll have to provide it's support first. This is one reason some people meet 1. Nf3 with 1...d5. It takes the game out of the realm of the English Opening (generally) . There are others who don't depend so fully on ...e5, so they might consider a King's Indian Defense set-up (generally aiming for ...e7-e5 after some development moves) or a symmetrical ...c7-c5.",True
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6,"This move continues to hide Black's intentions, to a certain extent. Often it's played like a Nimzo-Indian Defense, so that 3. Nc3 Bb4 helps Black fight for control of d5 and e4. To achieve the same end he might continue with the direct and classical ...d7-d5 or with a more modern Queen's Indian Defense (...b7-b6, ...Bc8-b7) . There are also other approaches: something completely different like ...c7-c5, delaying the development of Bc8 until he has ...Nb8-c6. To add to the confusion there is also a possibility of a Benoni Defense (3. d4 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6) when Black fianchettoes the dark-square bishop after all. It's potentially quite confusing.",False
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5,"Black has had good success with this, with GM Nick DeFirmian as one of it's best proponents. It aims to play an open position after d2-d4 cxd4 very actively before White can develop and remove his king from the center. White should move with some caution.",True
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. g3 b6,"Black chooses a kind of Queen's Indian Defense formation with an early ...c7-c5. By attempting to nullify White's Bg2 early-on Black should do alright. He's also kept Pd7 to keep Ke8 safe and to guard c6. Keeping those pawns (Pd7, Pe6, Pf7) on light squares can be very useful if Bc8 is traded off. If there is no early trade we might see those pawns move to other squares (...d7-d5 for example) .",False
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1,GM Walter Browne utilized this plan against GM Alexander Ivanov several years ago in the United States championship. It was copied by many people soon after and usually with good results. Black hadn't planned (perhaps) on having to deal with another White pawn advancing in the center so quickly. White threatens e2-e4-e5 when Nf6 isn't well prepared to move.,True
1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1 Ne4,"This is a nice response. Just get rid of the knight. White can't utilize the diagonal because ...Ne4xc3 hits White's queen. So, White would have to move Nc3 to avoid the trade and then try to exploit the exposed Ne4.",True

Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d3 Bb7 10. e4,"Vallejo Pons used the Pc4 & Pe4 formation in his game against Kasparov, so this isn't unfamiliar to him. Those pawns block both Bg2 and Bb7, so let's look at other factors to decide who is better or has a better continuation. With e4-e5 it's hard to see Black getting a grip on the dark squares with ...Nb8-c6, ...d7-d5, ...Be7-f6, but Black could challenge Pe4 more directly with ...d7-d5 or ...O-O and ...f7-f5. White will have to concede to pawn exchanges (else his central pawn structure would become broken) or to moving Nf3, so he can advance f2-f4. I'd favor Black, but that's just personal taste.",True

White opens things up, but he doesn't have the best grip on d5 since Nc3 is gone. Maybe now Black can play on the dark squares a little more actively.",True

Qd2 Rad8 19. g4 Nc5 20. b4 g6,"It appears Adams decided he might need that bishop for later duty, perhaps defending Pd6, and so he gives it a retreat square. Nc5 can only be captured if White is willing to lose Nd4 in return; the d-file would open and Nd4 would be pinned to Qd2.",True
