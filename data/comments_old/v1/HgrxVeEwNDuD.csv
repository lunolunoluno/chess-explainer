knight which is why it does not matter that it is
deprived of c3. There is nothing wrong with the
temporary blocking of the queen bishop for the Lopez
is a positional opening in which events develop
slowly. But 6. Bg5 or 6. 0-0 followed by 7. Bg5 is
also good.",False

on Black's d5 and f5. This procedure was originated
by Steinitz in one of the games of his match with
Blackburne in 1876. Later it became standard in many
variations of the Lopez. Also very good was first 0-0
and then Re1 followed by Nf1.  But Steinitz was fond
of delaying castling when such a strategy was
playable In this way he kept open the option of 
castling on the queenside.",True

time. White plans to respond with Qe2 if Black should
play d5 guarding his king pawn and preventing the
exchange of queens. If Black should then play Bd7

c2 so that Black cannot force its exchange with

to follow it up with Nb6 and d5 advancing in the
center.  However Black played it with the idea of
continuing in this way; Nc5 Ne6 (The knight will be
loose on c5 after Black plays d5.) Ne7 and finally
d5. An awfully slow plan!  Black had two good
alternatives; 8...a6 followed by b5 and d5 (or Na5 
followed by c5 putting pressure on Whites d4 if White
plays Bb3 instead of of Bc2 and 8...d5 at once. 
Indeed there is a certain logic to the latter move; 
White has lost a tempo with 8. Ba4 so Black can 
afford to lose one by moving his queen pawn twice.",True
