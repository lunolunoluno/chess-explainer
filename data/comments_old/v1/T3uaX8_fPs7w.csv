origional idea of my own, developed ia a series of OTB games over the past
couple of years or so between myself and my local friend, George McRobert, so
I was not following theory. Much later during this game I was to discover that
this opening sequence of moves had indeed been played before by a number of
English Grandmasters from the early 1980's onwards. My own experience with
this opening led me to believe that this  was a very strong sequence for White
to play, and it actually caused  George McRobert to discard the St. George
from his repertoire, so overwhelming was my score against him with it!!",True

being that Black has exchanged his b-pawn for White's c-pawn and fianchettoed
his queen's Bishop, so now ...Bxc3 isn't really much of a threat because White
doesn't get doubled c-pawns and b2xc3 further supports the White centre, so

move for Black here was the immediate 15...Nc5!, and the Bishop cannot go to

was no urgency for either side to castle!",False
