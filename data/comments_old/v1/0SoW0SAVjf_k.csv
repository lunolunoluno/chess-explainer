have doubled the rooks by moving the same rook to K Kt 4, threatening Q to B 4,

by R to B 4, ch. Black had then nothing better than to capture the R with the
P, for if he attempted to support the Q by K to Kt 3, R to B 6, ch. followed.
But the latter mode of play left, however, the chances of long protracted and
perhaps complicated fight open, and the line of play in the text had therefore
the preference of greater simplicity, though it was not as prompt and decisive
