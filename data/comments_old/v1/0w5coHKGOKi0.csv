1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5,This makes me wonder what Shirov had in mind that might make Kasparov change direction. This move is so out of character for Kasparov that I have doubts he has any kind of theoretical novelty; instead I think he just wants to prevent Shirov from having his way.,False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. O-O Bg7 5. c3 Nf6,"This is a typical, and necessary, response to White's effort to get the central pawn duo (Pe4 & Pd4) . Black continues developing, castles and hits Pe4 to force a resolution of the central pawns.",True

The main difference, of course, is the pawn at e5 rather than (say) e3. White's Bc1 can still develop freely and Bg7 is blocked, but Pd4 is also permanently weak.",True

Na4 g5,"Yes, this is ugly, but it's the only way to force Nh4 back, block Pf2 and free Bg7. It doesn't appear to hurt the safety of Kg8 since there are several pieces around him to defend. There is, however, still a possibility of Ne4 becoming stuck, as in the Kasparov-Adams game (Petrov's Def.) where Black's Qe4 got stuck.",True

Nd7,"If the best Kasparov can do is regain one of the bishops then he has to admit Black's success, or rather his own inability to put a dent in Shirov's fine play.
