unknown italian player Muzio D'Alessandro. Funny things like this one are
often present in the Chess Theory. Tartakover, with irony, called it ""the
Short-Sighted Lady"". Although nowadays nobody is so brave to play this
sacrifice, it is fully justified by the practice and the analysis. White's
play must be very carefull and accurate in order to keep equality.",False

reply for Black 13... Qe6 with the continuation 14. Qf2 (Unclear would be 14.
