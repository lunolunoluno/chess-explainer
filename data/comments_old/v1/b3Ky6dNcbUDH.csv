1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3,"This could be just a move-order trick, or a signal that white is going to play one of the systems without c2-c4, for example the Torre (3.Bg5) or the Zukertort (3.e3, 4. Bd3, 5. b3,...). As a generality, if white is just going to play c4 later, I think this move loses more flexibility than it gains.  However, once you know your own and your opponent's repertoire this may not be the case. For example black cannot get a Benko proper now if white doesn't want to co-operate. This may have been what black had in mind, because he isn't happy to let white transpose to one of various standard openings, so the game goes down a relatively original path.",True

It takes a lot of courage to explore these variations that are off the beaten track, and for that Degraeve gets my respect. I remember annotating some of my own games a couple years ago that reached distinctly messy positions, and it was incredible to me how many mistakes and outright blunders were made in such games. Even 450 points up the rating ladder, I suspect that it isn't easy.",False

Without this move, black is behind in development, but had good prospects with a grip on the center, and a better pawn structure. Now he is losing the fight in the center, coming under pressure on the queenside, falls further begind in development (e4 hitting the bishop), and is fighting to stay alive.",True

In this case it all comes to a disappointment for black, but 14...Kxe7, increasing co-ordination along the back rank, is nonetheless a nice motif to remember. 14...Qxe7 15.Rxa7 was simply losing, but now he is ready to meet 15.Rxa7 with 15...Nd7 and 16...Nb6.  Of course white is still much better here and black doesn't have any active compensation for the pawn, but the extra pawn is on the queenside where black has a sturdy blockade, and he just might be able to hold.",False

Instead of taking the pawn, white prefers to triple pieces on the a-file and simply maintain the pressure. In some ways leaving black's pawn on the board doesn't make his position any easier to play, but I wonder nonetheless, did Hebden just assume he could triple pieces and pick up the a7-pawn at his leisure?
