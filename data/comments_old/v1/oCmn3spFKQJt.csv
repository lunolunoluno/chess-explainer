Rxd4 Qc7,"If black had one more move to get castled then the game could be abandoned for a draw, but it is white's turn and he demonstrates the idea behind 8.Bb5+.  12...Qc6 would have prevented white's next but leads to great complications after 13.Ne5.  Still, I can't find anything concrete so perhaps white was just bluffing after all.",False

You have to keep in mind that this structure is not always so bad for black - for instance in many Sicilians, so that is why I was so impressed with how convincingly white takes it from here. It is true that compared to other lines white's rooks are very good here, and black's bishop is passive.",False
