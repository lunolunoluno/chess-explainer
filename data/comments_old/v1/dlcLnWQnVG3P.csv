very quickly, meaning most of this is probably theory in the Fritz opening
book. Here we should take stock. Fritz just played a good move (10. h4)
securing his f4 knight by preventing the natural g5 advance by black. However,
the f4 knight seems like white's only trump. The pawns on c3 an c4 are weak,
black has the two knights in a closed position, and white's king is in the
center while black's is in safety. However, the c4 pawn has the useful
function of keeping the knight out of d5 while the c3 fellow solidifies d4.
White has a solid position, but unless the bishops can be unleashed, black
will have a slight advantage.",True

freeing c5 move for white. For instance 10...Ne7 11. h5 c5! 12. Ba3 Qa5 etc.

f4 is prevented. Or if 10...Qe8!? 11. Ba3 Qf7 12. h5 b6 and if white plays the
