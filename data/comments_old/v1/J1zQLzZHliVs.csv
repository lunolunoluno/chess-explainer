1. d4,"Personally, I
don't recommend my students playing 1.d4 until they are about class ""A""
strength. 1.d4 very often leads to strategic play, and 1.e4 is often direct
and tactical. The problem is, there are more strategical concepts than
tactical in chess, so 1.d4 is harder to play well. I know some players avoid 1.
e4 because of the theory involved, but once you understand positions resulting
of 1.e4, it really does help understanding 1.d4. This was true for myself.",False
1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3,"Already a strategical miscue happens. Because of black's
inaccurate move 2, white can get nice central control and space with 3. cxd5
Nxd5 4. e4 Nb6 5. Nf3. The pawns on d4 and e4 are called the ""ideal"" pawn
center.",True
1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3,"Unfortunately, this is one of those positions
where the fianchetto of the bishop isn't very effective. White's bishop is
blocked by the black d-pawn, and there is no way to dislodge it except by an
eventual e4. But if white does that, then white will be obliged to recapture
with a piece, and this leaves white's d-pawn isolated. See all the strategical
concepts I was talking about? In this position, much more promising is quick
development with 5. Bg5, then a later e3, Bd3, Nf3, etc. The text should give
black a nice game.",True
1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3 Bb4 6. Bd2,"Unnecessarily passive. Quick king-side
castling is white's best chance for an advantage. Therefore 6. Bg2 is the best
chance. 6. ... Ne4 is not really a threat, because 7. Qb3 defends against the
threat and counter-attacks. This kind of defense-counterattack tactic is
fairly common in 1.e4.",True
1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3 Bb4 6. Bd2 Bxc3,"Black shouldn't have released the pressure.
Simply O-O is logical and strong. Black could then follow it up with ...Re8, ..
.c6, ...Bf5, ...Nbd7, with a nice game because of the clamp on the central e4
square. Only if white wastes a tempo with a3 should black capture the knight
at c3.",True

White is opening up the center before he's completed development. Luckily for
white, black didn't play the most active line.",True

threat on b7, but much more interesting was 11. ... O-O!? 12 Bxb7 Bd5! 13.
Bxa8 Re8+ 14. Ne2 Bxa8, with a clear advantage for black! Note that if white
tries 15. O-O, then white will be extremely weak on the light squares.
Otherwise, 15. Rg1?? loses to 15. ... Bf3. This line just illustrates the
dangers of opening up the center too early.",True

prevent white from castling, and threatens ...O-O and ...Re8, which would be

already has mating material, simply going for mate is sufficient. Therefore,
cutting off black's king is logical, with either Qb6 or Qd5, and simply
advancing white's king.",True
