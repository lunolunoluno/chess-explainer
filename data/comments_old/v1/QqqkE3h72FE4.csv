of the isolated d-pawn (/\cxd4) is good here. It shows mature thought, even if
it was not intentional. We all learn to automatically filter some things by
instinct. This is a time saver but must be deliberately challenged. In this
filtering process we develop bias such as (+)labels.[+] (e.g. ethnic and
religious affiliations) These tend to put blinders on us. In chess, the basic
teacher develops a set of rules and presents them in lessons. This system of
indoctrinating the student is good because they must be understood since
violating them means terrible consequences. Having come to understand the
basic filters and biases we then learn to develop (+)exceptions[+] and deeper
understandings. It is the difference between following the Law and living by
the Spirit. One such 'law' in chess is that the isolated pawn is a (+)bad[+]
thing. Typically, if you know how to handle the position, the isolated pawn
can be difficult from either perspective. The fact that you either
intentionally passed on this idea or unintentionally filtered the idea shows
good potential. If it was an unintentional filter then you must focus energy
on questioning these filters.",True

is a fine line between a (+)great[+] player and a (+)good[+] player. Several
distinguishing characteristics are important to note at this point. For
instance the (+)great[+] player has in reserve a larger number of recognized

the sense of when the position is critical. This is such a moment. Normally,
I'd rail on this move but you had the courage to send in the game and learn
something useful. Getting back to the idea of material, I like taking at a2.

Coach's advice: For courage in allowing me to examine a lost game A+! This
shows a desire to actually correct faulty thinking processes. (If only I could
have your thoughts as you were thinking them/\..) So some ideas/\/\ Challenge
your filters. You seem to be unwilling to grab the pawn when it was available
but unwilling to give up the pawn for a greater good (winning the Queen).
Start paying attention to these filters and force yourself to look beyond
these (+)laws[+] you have learned. The truth is on the board, not on a set of
learned rules. You show good positional judgment but do not seem to have good
attacking skills. The problem with good positional judgment is that if you
focus here, it is not enough to win! Somewhere you must attack, even if it is
(+)pawn picking.[+] I'd suggest that you develop a (+)catalogue of positions.
[+] To do this get some cards or a notebook where you will record positions
for games you play or see. Somewhere keep a (+)key[+] on the correct moves by
category. Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe topics would include (+)
sacrifice[+], (+)pawns[+], (+)king safety.[+] Don't buy a book! You must do
the work yourself, if a position strikes you enough for you to take the time
to record it then you are more likely to learn it for yourself. I see that you
are a (+)club[+] player. Clubs are fun and often good chess but/\.. The
tendency is to play (+)cat and mouse[+] games with the other players minds.
I'd suggest that you settle into three systems (two with Black and one with
White) and play them regardless of who you play and what your opponent played
last time. Here is the trick. You opponents will prepare for you, since you
will be predictable, and will find the most difficult lines for you. That is
good, they will test you and force you to grow and develop good lines. It will
also force you to be precise in your opening moves. The idea is that you will
have three openings that you know as well as anyone in the world and can play
in any circumstance. Nb3",True
