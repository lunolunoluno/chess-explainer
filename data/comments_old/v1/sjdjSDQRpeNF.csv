1. e4 Nf6,"Wow! This is interesting. None of the top GMs plays anything this provocative. It is, of course, played by many people at all levels of chess, except at the top. Why does Ivanchuk choose it for this game? One possibility is that he saw Vallejo Pons playing rather solid positions and ""offered"" a possibility of something more unbalanced and tactical.",False
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3,"And already White flinches from the main contest (2. e5) . With this I suspect both players are on their own (out of book) . With Nc3 White isn't able to support a d2-d4 with c2-c3, so f2-f4 is more likely. In that case the game could resemble a King's Gambit more than an Italian or Spanish Game.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3,"After Black's first-move provocation Vallejo Pons is proceeding very cautiously, perhaps even more than he might normally. Can Ivanchuk play aggressively to exploit that over-caution? How would he go about it? Oftentimes when one player doesn't use pawns much the other can overwhelm him with pawns. But, it depends upon the opening. Too much use of pawns in some openings just leads to difficulties.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3,"After this it's quite possible Black will aim for ...Bh3 to trade-off Bg2, thereby weakening all the light squares on the king-side. Opening the center with ...d7-d5 would be unwise because it opens the diagonal for Bg2, making it stronger.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3,"By defending Pe4 White is now free to play Nc3-a4xc5. This would get rid of the bishop, but at the cost of opening the d-file for Black. Still it might be good.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3 a6,Ivanchuk clearly wants to keep Bc5 to keep control of d4 and perhaps to have a piece which reaches all the way to f2 (or g1) to threaten White's king. This extra pawn move seems justified.,False
1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Bg2 d6 6. d3 a6 7. h3,"White clearly has an idea of how to coordinate his king-side, to avoid damage. But, such a passive position might still allow Black chances.",False

Bg2 d6 6. d3 a6 7. h3 O-O,"The king-side seems the natural place for active play (for both White or Black) , so removing the king to the queen-side, where it's adequately defended by Bc5 and Nc6, should be safer and enables freer offensive actions on the king-side.",True

White has no more king-side attack (it appears this would weaken his own king's safety too much) and Black's queen-side demonstration has quieted.,True

Kh2 Ne5,"At first glance I thought this game was ""remarkably equal throughout"", but upon further study I realized there was a gradual shift to Black in the opening, then back to White in the middle-game and with Black's queen-side action (which White apparently didn't handle properly) the balance was restored. Though there wasn't any direct attack on a king there wasn't a static balance throughout.",True
