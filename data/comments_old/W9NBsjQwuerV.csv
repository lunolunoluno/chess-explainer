1. e4,"Although Kasparov is one point ahead he might lose his last round game to Shirov, so it's important for Ponomariov to try to win this one. He's the only player who could catch Kasparov.",False
1. e4 e5,"After seeing the Sicilian Defense so many times it's quite a curious thing to see this recent trend (at least amongst the top-level GMs) toward 1. e4 e5 with both the Petrov's Defense and 2. Nf3 Nc6 being played. The so-called hypermodern defenses have been relegated to the back-burner. I haven't seen a Modern/Pirc or Alekhine's Defense game for a long time. And, although the Caro-Kann and French Defenses are still played they're clearly in the minority.",False
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O,"Now this is interesting. I don't recall seeing Anand threaten or play the Marshall Gambit. Why on earth has this variation experienced a resurgence in recent years? Of course, it goes through ups and downs as people play it, discover problems, study it and then play it again. Perhaps it's just that other defenses seem to have a few more adherents than this one, so that the ups and downs of some Sicilian Defense or Queen's Gambit variation is hardly noticed. One must remember also, there are many variations of a Spanish and this is but one.",False

Re4,"It seems odd to move the rook so many times, but White must use whatever pieces are available to get the job done. It was once thought White should develop Bc1-e3, Qd1-d3, Nb1-d2, Qd3-f1. But, Re1-e4 forces either a retreat or other concession from Black and enables Qd1-f1.",True

Qe2 f5,"In Ponomariov-Adams from round 9 Ponomariov established Re4 as a perimeter and offered for Black to capture it with a minor piece. He also played f2-f3 to support that perimeter. As a result his king was weakened a bit, but Black didn't quite break through and was pushed back. In this game Anand is using a pawn to challenge Re4, so this game ought to have a different appearance and the clash might occur more on Black's terms.",True

Re6,"It's amazing that White isn't developed and he continues to offer this exchange sac AND Black refuses to take it because the pawn pushes have exposed his king -- he needs to keep pieces on the board to keep his king safe, at least from a perpetual check. How can Black get free to continue his offensive if White mucks it up by threatening Bd6 or checks to Kg8?",True
