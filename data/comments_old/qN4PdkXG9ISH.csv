I think it is very revealing to see the ways 9.exd5 and 9.Nxd5 get punished. Then one realizes that, assuming he had seen black's idea, he probably would have played it too.",True

Qe4,"I'm not sure exactly why Shirov didn't play 16.Rb1. Did he understand that it was an objectively bad move, see some deep tactical refutation, or just prefer to return material over passive defense. It seems clear that black gets prolonged play for the piece, but I don't see how he can convert it to something before the material tells. Another issue is that white's position could be very fun to play after 16.Qe4.",True

Kxd2 Qb2+ 19. Kd3 Qxa1 20. e6,"This move really ""made the game"" for me. There's something about the wide open space around white's centralized monarch that makes it seem odd that white is the one attacking the opponent's king. Thus, the sheer audacity of the move is immediately compelling. Unfortunately the logical reasons for the move are not so easy to explain without getting into detailed variations, but I find this is often the case with Shirov's games; rarely could he be accused of playing transparently!",True
