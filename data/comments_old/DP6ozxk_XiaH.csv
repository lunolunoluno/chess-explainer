1. e4,"The following game is, I think, a very instructive and thematic example of what black is playing for in the King's Gambit with 3...g5. All of black's strategy is based around keeping the ""weakling"" pawn on f4 alive, because from a dynamic point of view it is incredibly annoying. Therefore, it is also a nice illustration of modern chess.",False

Ne5 d6,"This is not necessarily better than 5...Nf6, but, to the extent that it is the beginning of a thematic plan black implements very nicely in this game, it deserves an exclam. Black has to choose between staying a pawn ahead and keeping the easy to protect g4-pawn, or allowing white to equalize material while the weak f4-pawn continues its precarious existence. He makes the dynamic choice because the f4-pawn is a great nuisance for white, blocking the f-file and the dark-squared bishop.",True

Bd2,"White approaches the position thus; the b2-pawn is immune because of Qxa7 in conjunction with Rb1, so it's time to finish development by mobilizing his rooks, and to get out of danger.  Apparently it was better to be greedy with 17.Bxe4 or even 17.dxe4.  The main idea would be to stop black's next, but it is hard to imagine white ever exploiting his extra pawn on the kingside since he is under so much pressure there.",True
