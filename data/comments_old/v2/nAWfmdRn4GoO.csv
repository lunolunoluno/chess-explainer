Protects the Bishop in b7 and prepares the possible push c7-c5.,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player because it describes a good defensive move and a potential offensive plan, which doesn't indicate that the player made a poor move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c8",-
Both the players keep a prudent attitude.,False,"

This comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it simply describes the general attitude of both players.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6",-
Again too mach prudent. Better would have been 8. d5 and after 8... Ne7 9. e4 exd5 10. cxd5 d6 11. O-O Ng6 12. Re1 White would have had some advantage in space and developement.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake as it suggests playing 8. d5, which would put White at a disadvantage, rather than addressing the actual error made in the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle",-
If Black would have not resisted from winning a Pawn with 11... dxc3 12. Bxc3 Qxc4 13. Ne5 Qc7 14. Bxb7 Qxb7 15. Nc4 he would have been in severe delay in developement and would have given very good chances to the opponent.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by describing the consequences of Black's move and how it led to a disadvantage in development.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f6"," 'Black's pawn takes on f6. Had they not captured that pawn, instead of playing dxc3, they would have faced significant development delays and provided White with excellent opportunities."
"The best, maybe. The exchange 12...Bxe4 would have been favourable to White.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by suggesting a better alternative move that would have been advantageous to the White player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to g8"," The last move by Black was not optimal, as it missed the chance for an exchange. Instead, White could have played 12...Bxe4 to gain a better position."
Uncertain. Probably 16.. .0-0 was better. With the Pawn sacrifice Black tries to exploit the opening of the g-file.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because the player sacrificed a pawn to exploit the opening of the g-file, which the commentator believes would have been more advantageous.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f4"," The pawn move by Black to f4 was not ideal. It could have been more advantageous for Black to perform a kingside castle (0-0). This strategy opens up the g-file, which Black might want to use for potential rook activity."
Lilienthal aceppts the challenge and ... takes the Pawn.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of taking a pawn (aceppts) and provides context by mentioning the player ""Lilienthal"" and the phrase ""takes the Pawn,"" which suggests a blunder or poor decision in chess terminology.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on f4", Lilienthal concedes the advantage and... captures the Pawn.
"And for the second time Black puts a light piece on its home square. This time, by the way, the retreat is justified. By protecting the d6 square it opens the file to the Rook.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies a recurring mistake of leaving a light piece on its home square, and explains the rationale behind the retreat as a strategic decision to open the Rook's file.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to f8"," Black opted for a light piece that retreated to its home square, which, although it offers protection to the d6 square, unfortunately neglects the development of the Rook."
The game is getting complicated. Of course now it is not convenient to play 20. Qxh5 because of di 20...Bxe4.,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it points out the complexity of the position and the consequences of the move 20. Qxh5, which would lead to a discovered check from the bishop at d2.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to g8"," White's next move could worsen the position. It's inadvisable to capture the pawn on g8 with the queen, as Black would respond with Bxe4, exploiting the queen's vulnerability."
"Combines its action with the Bishop and, by protecting the h5 Knight it threats 22...Rxg2 followed by 23.Qxe4.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it points out that the move allowed the opponent to threaten a capture with Rxg2, followed by Qxe4, putting pressure on important pieces and squares.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21. Red1 Qd5,"This is a game between Lilienthal, André (as White) and Kertesz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d5"," Black's move threatens the White's h5 Knight by playing Queen to d5. This action might lead to White capturing the Knight with their Queen, followed by White's Queen taking on e4."
And now? What to do next? If White takes the Queen after 24. Nxh5 it would follow 24...Bxg2+ with all its unclear consequences. If 23... Ke7 White declines the Queen and after 24. Nxg8+ Kd8 25. Bxb7 it is in very good shape.,True,"

The comment appropriately explains the possible consequences of the player's move, indicating it was a mistake and providing alternative strategies for White to consider.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21.

Should White capture the Queen with 24. Nxh5, Black could respond with 24...Bxg2+. This move is unclear in its implications. Alternatively, if 23....Ke7, White chooses not to take the Queen. Following this, White plays 24. Nxg8+ Kd8 and then 25. Bxb7. This line puts Black in a very favorable position."""
Here is the solution!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it lacks any specific details or analysis of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8.

The Knight could not be taken: 24... fxe6 25. Rxd7+ Kc8 26.Bxb7+ Kb8 27. Nxh5,True,"

The comment appropriately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the loss of the Knight due to an unforced mate sequence.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21. Red1 Qd5 22.

Last move played: Black plays King to e7"," The move 24...fxe6 was poor because it allowed White to capture the Knight with 25.Rxd7+, putting Black in check and gaining spatial advantage with 26.Bxb7+. After 26...Kc8, White's Nxh5 would threaten the Queen, improving White's position while Black's King remains vulnerable."
"When a player prefers to take a Rook instead of a Queen, there are two possibilites: he is totally confused, or he has seen the way to the victory.",True,"

The comment suggests that the player chose a Rook over a Queen, implying a strategic sacrifice that could lead to a winning position, indicating an understanding of the game's depth rather than confusion.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21.

The endgame rulting from 27... Qxd5 28. Rxd5 Kxd5 29. Nf6+ followed by 30...Nxh7 would be hopeless for Black.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it discusses a hypothetical scenario rather than addressing the actual move played.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21.

The comment provides a clear sequence of moves that demonstrates the mistake made by the player and highlights the potential consequences of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5.

After 30... Kxf4 White mates after few moves. If 30... Kg4 mate in two. So what is the point in going further? Mate in one and it'sover!,True,"

The comment succinctly explains the mistake by highlighting the immediate threat of mate against Black's king, making the move unnecessary and ineffective.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nf3 Qc8 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. a3 a6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Qc2 c5 10. Bg5 cxd4 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne4 Ng8 13. Nxd4 f5 14. Nd2 Bg7 15. Qd3 Nf6 16. Rfe1 f4 17. gxf4 Nh5 18. Ne4 Bf8 19. Qf3 Rg8 20. Kf1 Qxc4 21.
