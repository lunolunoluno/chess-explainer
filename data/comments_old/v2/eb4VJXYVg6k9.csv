"Scandinavian defence - a solid, but inactive set up. In contrast, 13-year old Sasha Morozevich was fond of complicated play, sometimes even to the detriment of his position. But everything changes in our world - a couple of years later Morozevich himself started to play the Scandinavian for Black! For example, in CT-100 our editor Graham Brown mentioned the Gurevich - Morozevich game (London 1994).",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player. It discusses the player's style and a historical example of his game instead of analyzing the specific move in question.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5,"This is a game between Morozevich, Alexander (as White) and Ovsejevitsch, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on d5",-
"White has more space, and has a pawn d4 in the centre. But Black has developed his Bishop on f5 very successfully, and the pawns e6 and c6 create a ""saw"" for the d4 pawn. Of course White has a small advantage but it's very difficult to realise something real.",True,"

The comment correctly highlights the mistake made by White due to overlooking Black's well-placed Bishop on f5 and the potential threat it poses to the pawn on d4.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 6. Bc4 Bf5 7. Bd2 e6,"This is a game between Morozevich, Alexander (as White) and Ovsejevitsch, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6"," Black has adequately developed the bishop to f5 and established a strong pawn formation with e6 and c6, creating a solid structure that challenges White's central pawn on d4. While White enjoys a space advantage, translating this into a tangible advantage is complex due to Black's solid defensive setup."
Morozevich doesn't avoid simplifications. But he invents a rather sharp plan...,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake because Morozovich's move led to simplification, which is generally avoided by players, but the player still managed to create a sharp plan despite the mistake.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 6. Bc4 Bf5 7. Bd2 e6 8. Bb3 Bb4 9. O-O O-O 10. Ne5 Nbd7 11. a3 Bxc3 12. Bxc3 Qc7 13. Nxd7,"This is a game between Morozevich, Alexander (as White) and Ovsejevitsch, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on d7"," White's knight sacrifice on d7 was not just a simplification but a risky, sharp strategy that could be considered poor judgement, considering it leaves White's position potentially weakened."
It looks like a small provocation. White is tempting his opponent to exchange his very strong Knight in exchange for destroying White's pawns.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as the move is indeed a provocation, hoping that the opponent will fall for the bait and exchange a valuable Knight, which could weaken White's position significantly.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3.

Re5,"This is a game between Morozevich, Alexander (as White) and Ovsejevitsch, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e5", The move is poor. White is risking their strong Knight by suggesting its trade for Black's pawns.
There is a well known chess joke: even the best knight is worse than the worst Bishop. But now Black remains without any counterplay for the immediate future.,True,"

The comment acknowledges the mistake made by the player and also highlights the lack of counterplay for Black, suggesting the move was indeed a mistake.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5.

Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on c3"," 'The joke highlights a common misconception in chess, yet here, Black has made a move that doesn't offer much potential for Black to challenge White immediately. Black's last action, playing the Knight on c3, isn't leveraging any strong counterplay options right now.'"
"Because Black can't open the centre, White began a pawn offence.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake because it assumes a specific strategy (opening the centre) without considering the context of the move in relation to the ongoing game situation.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3.

White agrees to return the pawn but has closed an open file.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the key mistake made by the player, which is closing an open file that could have been used for strategic purposes.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"," White's decision to recapture the pawn might seem strategic at first, but it has the unintended consequence of closing an important file, limiting their own rooks' movement."
"A curious situation! The White Monarch is alone and very weak but the Black pieces have no way to come to see it. In time trouble and in an unpleasant position, Black made a decisive mistake:",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the Black player, who played poorly in a difficult position and in time pressure.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 6.

Queen has to stop the f6-pawn...,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting that the queen should have been moved to stop the f6-pawn.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 6.
