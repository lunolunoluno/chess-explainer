"One of Nimzovich's original ideas, which, has now been widely analyzed.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it refers to a historical chess concept rather than evaluating the move itself.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to a6",-

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting an alternative move (5)Qa4) which could have been played instead of the actual move made, and then outlines a series of counter-moves that Black could have played to maintain a strong position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3"," The move 5)Qa4 was not strategically sound as it led to weakening Black's pawn structure. Subsequent moves allowed Black to solidify their position, with the sequence starting from 5)...Be7, followed by Black castling with 6. Bg2 O-O, and advancing the pawn to c6 with 7). This pawn support enabled Black to challenge White's central control. White's knight move to c3 at 8) was met with a strong response from Black's pawn to d5 at 9). Black's surprising queen maneuver to Qe8 at 9) added pressure on White's position. The resulting tension led to a complex middle game with both sides vying for control."
(7. Bd2 Be7!(A common idea in such positions. The Bishop on d2 is misplaced.. 8. Nc3 O-O 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Ne5 Bb7 =.),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by identifying the Bishop on d2 as being misplaced, which indicates a lack of coordination and potential weakness in the player's position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"," This move by White, playing knight to d2, is not the best choice. The bishop on d2 is too far from the center and not optimally placed."
Energetic play by Smyslov casts doubts on White's previous extravagant move. Otherwise White would have played a3 followed by e4.,True,"
The comment correctly identifies a mistake by the player, suggesting a better alternative move (a3 followed by e4) and indicating a potentially hasty or uncalculated decision.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"," ""Smyslov's energetic play raises questions about White's previous overly ambitious move. Without this, White would have likely played a3 followed by e4."""
A careless exchange. The resultant isolated pawn position is not much important since it allows too much leeway to the Black pieces. Better is 12. Na4 and only after 12)...Bb4 13. cxd5 when 13)... exd5 14. a3 Re8! 15. axb4 Bxe2 16. Qb1 Bf1 17. Nf1 Nxb4 18)Bc3 Nc6 19. Qf5 d4 20. Bb2 Nb4 21. Rd1 d3 with a very unclear position not certainly recommendable to the faint hearted.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by highlighting the isolation of the pawn and the potential threats from Black, indicating that the move was indeed careless.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5"," Black's move pawn to d5 was a mistake. It leads to an isolated pawn, but Black has flexibility with their pieces. A better move was 12. Na4, followed by 13)...Bb4, which then 14. cxd5 could be met by exd5, leading to 15)...Re8! 16. axb4 Bf1 17. Nf1 Nxb4 18) Bc3 Nc6 19. Qf5 d4 20. Bb2 Nb4 21. Rd1 d3. The position is unclear and risky."
A move too late.,True,"

The comment ""A move too late"" aptly describes the mistake made by the player as it indicates that the move was made at an inappropriate time, possibly missing an opportunity or allowing an unfavorable development.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to a4", White's move to a4 was premature.
What else ? If 14. Re1 Nc2 15. Qxc2 Bxf2+ 16. Kxf2 Rxc2 -+){,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by outlining the sequence of moves that leads to a significant disadvantage for White, suggesting that the move 14. Re1 is a critical error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4 Nd4 14.

Re1 by White allows Black's knight to capture on c2, followed by a winning exchange of queens with 15. Qxc2. After the exchange, Black's rook captures on c2, leading to a favorable material gain for Black with a rook and a queen against White's king."
"(14...Bb4, with the idea of destroying the main defender of the e2-pawn, doesn't serve the purpose because of the cool 15. Ndb1! . Black has a combination in store against White's next move which is probably the only move in the position.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black; the move (14...Bb4) doesn't effectively counter White's strategy or create the necessary threats, allowing White to respond with a strong move (15. Ndb1).",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4 Nd4 14.

"Natural, but not good.",True,"
The comment correctly identifies the move as natural, which implies it could have been a reasonable choice in a different context, but it also acknowledges that it was not good, meaning it was a mistake in the current situation.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4 Nd4 14. Nc3 Qe7 15. Re1,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1", The move was natural but unwise.
"""The straw that breaks the camel's back.""",False,"

The comment ""The straw that breaks the camel's back"" is often used to describe a small act that causes a large, sudden reaction, but it doesn't specifically evaluate the quality of the chess move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4 Nd4 14. Nc3 Qe7 15.

The comment explains the mistake by outlining the dangerous consequences of the move, as it allows the opponent to create a series of threats and combinations that can lead to a swift checkmate.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 d5 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Nfd2 c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O Nc6 11. Nc3 Rc8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Na4 Nd4 14. Nc3 Qe7 15. Re1 Nc2 16. Rf1,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Uhlmann (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to f1"," The move 16. Qxc2 is poor because it exposes White's king. After 16...Bxf2+, Black threatens checkmate with 17...Be1. White's forced response, 18. Re1, leads to a strong counterplay by Black with 18...d4. This sequence of moves shows a lack of coordination in White's pieces that could have been avoided, resulting in a difficult position for White."
Smyslov's all time favourite setup was the Queen's Indian Defense setup in which he had such mastery that nobody could dispute .The above game amply drives home the point.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it talks about Smyslov's favorite setup and his mastery, which has nothing to do with the specific move in question.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
