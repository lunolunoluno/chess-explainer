The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights Grischuk's attempt at playing the English Attack without addressing the significant Kasparov Variation, which the opponent could have exploited.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f3,"This is a game between Grischuk, A. (as White) and Kasparov, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3", White initiated a Petrov's Defense. Grischuk aims to avoid the decisive Kasparov Variation by choosing the English Attack but this move does not effectively address the threat.

The comment correctly identifies the mistake and provides a strategic alternative for Black to avoid the English Attack.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6"," Black should realize that even with Grischuk's impressive history, including a victory over Kasparov, moving the Queen to b6 isn't the best strategy to avoid the English Attack. It's still a risky play."

I think by now Kasparov was regretting he hadn't placed the bishop on c7 - White's no worse here.,True,"
