"I'm surprised to see this move. I'd been thinking about it and then saw a game GM Yudasin - IM Nakamura from a recent event and now here it is again. White's idea is to not commit to d2-d4 and to perhaps threaten c2-c3, d2-d4 when he's used Bc4 to prevent the counter ...d6-d5. Black can easily play ...Ng8-f6 or ...Nb8-c6, but he must realize White's possible plan to achieve d2-d4, else he'll have no offensive potential.",True,"

The comment accurately explains why the move was a mistake by pointing out White's potential plan and the lack of counterplay for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to c4"," White's move to play Bishop to c4 may seem unusual.

The move restricts Black's options, forcing them to choose between...Ng8-f6 or...Nb8-c6. However, Black must be wary; if they fail to anticipate White's move to d2-d4, they risk having no chances to attack."

Shirov aims to blunt the bishop and prepares ...d6-d5. He might also use ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it describes Shirov's intentions to provoke and counter the opponent's bishop, which indicates the player might have played a move that weakened their position or created unnecessary threats.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black).

The annotation correctly identifies the potential weakness created by the move 5...d5, allowing White to counter it decisively with 6. e5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black).

It weakened their control over the center and allowed Black (Alexei) to potentially respond with d5, challenging White's position. If White desires to maintain central dominance, they should consider advancing their pawn to e5."
"He's over-protected Pe4, so Pd3 can advance. Black has a couple of choices after d3-d4. One is ...d6-d5 e4-e5 which produces a French Defense kind of pawn structure, but the early ...O-O might not be favorable. Another is ...e6-e5 which produces a Ruy Lopez kind of structure except Black hasn't weakened his queen-side (or gained space if that's a plan you prefer for Black) . Now that White has a Pc3 and couldn't utilize a weaker square d5 it might be good for Black to play 8...e6-e5 in anticipation of 9. d3-d4 Bg4.",True,"

The comment provides an analysis of the potential moves and consequences of the mistake made by the player, explaining why Pd3 is a better option and discussing the various outcomes based on Black's responses.",1. e4 c5 2.

Considering White's unused d5 square, Black might plan 8...e6-e5 in preparation for 9. d3-d4 Bg4."
White supports Pe5 and prepares for Bb3-c2 to take aim at Ph7 (and Kg8) .,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake; it actually suggests a good move that aims at the opponent's king, which is unrelated to the mistake being evaluated.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3.

I wonder if later he might miss this piece from c8 where it could defend Pe6 in a few critical cases when Black would want to play ...f7-f5 to block the b1-h7 diagonal.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a potential tactical oversight where the player failed to consider the defensive possibility for the black bishop on c8 to defend against the white pawn's advance along the b1-h7 diagonal.",1. e4 c5 2.

The comment ""student body right"" does not explain the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9.

This is certainly an odd utilization of the bishop.,True,"

The comment indicates that the player made an unusual or unconventional use of their bishop, which likely contributed to the move being considered a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9. Nbd2 d5 10. e5 Nd7 11. d4 Ba6 12. Nf1 b4 13.

This certainly solves a lot of Black's problems. Kg8 is a lot safer and Black already has control of the only open file (Rc8) . By trading a couple of minor pieces it should also be easier for Black to maneuver comfortably.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the safer move (Kg8) and the control Black has over the open file (Rc8), suggesting that trading minor pieces could facilitate better positioning for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9. Nbd2 d5 10. e5 Nd7 11. d4 Ba6 12. Nf1 b4 13. Ba4 Rc8 14. Bxc6 Rxc6 15. cxb4 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 cxb4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on b4", Vallejo Pons' decision to move Kg8 wasn't the best choice. It leaves Black with less protection and allows White some control over the board. Trading minor pieces might give Black a better chance to position themselves since they already have a strong presence on the b-file.
"This slows Black's pieces considerably. Be7 is plainly blocked by Pb4 and White's central pawns block Nd7. Ne1 is necessary to prevent ...Rc2. Black could even look at ...f7-f6xe5 to open some lines. Unfortunately it's the f-file which would open for Rf1. The fact is there's no easy way for Black to force a confrontation of his pieces with White's, or to get at Kg1. Black has to be patient and await developments.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the weaknesses and lack of potential for Black's position, emphasizing the need for patience and better development.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9. Nbd2 d5 10. e5 Nd7 11. d4 Ba6 12. Nf1 b4 13. Ba4 Rc8 14. Bxc6 Rxc6 15. cxb4 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 cxb4 17. Be3 Qa5 18. g3 Rfc8 19.

Consequently, there's no straightforward method for Black to challenge White's pieces or to target White's King. Black has to be patient and wait for the right moment to proceed."
"I'm not terribly fond of this move. It places the pawn enprise and can only advance, leaving Pb4 backward or exchange for b3, opening the a-file for White.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by highlighting the positional weakness created by the pawn move, which leaves the pawn en prise and opens lines for the opponent's pieces.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9. Nbd2 d5 10. e5 Nd7 11. d4 Ba6 12. Nf1 b4 13. Ba4 Rc8 14. Bxc6 Rxc6 15. cxb4 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 cxb4 17. Be3 Qa5 18. g3 Rfc8 19.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a4"," Vallejo Pons (white) plays a pawn to a4, which doesn't offer much strategic advantage and weakens their pawn structure."
"White offers Pb3, knowing he threatens a strong attack.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake, as offering the pawn (Pb3) can be an aggressive move to threaten a stronger attack, which may not be a good strategy depending on the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 Nc6 8. Re1 b5 9. Nbd2 d5 10. e5 Nd7 11. d4 Ba6 12. Nf1 b4 13. Ba4 Rc8 14. Bxc6 Rxc6 15. cxb4 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 cxb4 17. Be3 Qa5 18. g3 Rfc8 19.

"It appears he's repositioning to attack Pf7, but that's probably not true. Pf7 is very easily defended by Qd7. Instead he's probably aiming to play Be3-g5xe7 to weaken the dark squares. That would give his queen a more clear path to g7 to give mate.",False,"

The comment incorrectly identifies the player's intentions and misinterprets the consequences of the move; the actual mistake is allowing for a potential attack on the king, not the defensive maneuvers suggested by the comment.",1. e4 c5 2.

This is a tense phase where White has to bring every single piece into play and yet prevent Pb3 from advancing very far.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake as a strategic oversight, where White failed to balance piece development with the defense against an opponent's pawn advance (Pb3).",1. e4 c5 2.

"There it is, the ideal location where he threatens Pb3 and Qf3-f6-g7#.",True,"
