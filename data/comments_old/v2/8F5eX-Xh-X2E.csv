"Taking me out of book. I was expecting 7.e5 or 7.h3. I didn't really understand 7.d5?! at the time, it struck me as rather illogical to play 5.Bc4 and then voluntarily block off the c4-g8 diagonal, to say nothing of taking away valuable support for the kind of move that he should've been thinking about playing either immediately or sometime in the near future, namely e5.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player as it discusses the strategic errors involved in playing 7.d5?!, which was unexpected and illogical according to the chess annotations, and highlights the missed opportunities for stronger moves like 7.e5 or 7.h3.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5,"This is a game between Armstrong, A. (as White) and Cumming, D R. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"," 'Whiteâ€™s move with Pawn to d5 seems off. I anticipated either 7.e5 or 7.h3. The decision for 7.d5 wasn't clear to me at that time. It seemed counterintuitive to play 5.Bc4, blocking the c4-g8 diagonal, and offering less support for the move e5 that White might have considered either immediately or in the near future.'"
"Played to prevent the obvious b5 & c4, winning the Bishop.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a preventive strategy that was not actually employed.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6.

"Intending 12...c4, winning the Bishop.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the intended but unsuccessful strategy of winning the Bishop with 12...c4.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7,"This is a game between Armstrong, A. (as White) and Cumming, D R. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c7"," Black's last move was Queen to c7, which is not a direct threat to White's pieces. The following comment is a simplification of why this move might be considered suboptimal:

""Playing 12...c4 does not immediately challenge White's strong position or capture any valuable material. It's an inactive move that doesn't capitalize on White's potential weaknesses."""
Played anyway.,True,"

The comment ""Played anyway"" indicates that the player acknowledges the mistake made in the move but proceeded to play it regardless.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6.

"White's queenside pawn formation has been broken up at the cost of a temporary pawn sacrifice, the Queen's have been exchanged, and I believe that Black now has a slight advantage.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the consequences of the pawn sacrifice and the resulting shift in the balance of power to Black's favor.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. b3 c4 13. Bxc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 Qxc4 15. bxc4 Nd7,"This is a game between Armstrong, A.

This has led to the exchange of the Queen, and now I surmise that Black might hold a slight edge."
A suitable time for a little prophylaxis.,True,"

The comment suggests that the player made a move that allowed their opponent to prepare a good defensive strategy, hence indicating a mistake in the player's move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4.

26.Rc1 was better. His actual 26th invited me to play the following...,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests an alternative move (26.Rc1) that would have been more favorable and avoids a tactical situation that the player fell into.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. b3 c4 13. Bxc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 Qxc4 15. bxc4 Nd7 16. Rab1 Ra7 17. Nd1 Rc7 18. Ne3 a5 19.

"Falling for it hook, line, & sinker. And what about all of those tempi he has lost mooving his Rook up and down the b file?",True,"

The comment accurately points out that the player fell for a tactical trap (hook, line, & sinker) and also criticizes the loss of tempo due to the unnecessary movement of the Rook along the b file.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. b3 c4 13. Bxc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 Qxc4 15. bxc4 Nd7 16. Rab1 Ra7 17. Nd1 Rc7 18. Ne3 a5 19.

Last move played: White plays Rook takes on b6"," ""White's move of Rook to b6 is overly simplistic and overlooks Black's potential counterplay. This leaves White's Rook vulnerable on the b file and misses the chance to optimize tempo."""
Now his Rook can't go home to it's back rank.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as moving the rook away from its original position on the back rank could potentially weaken the player's defensive structure.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. b3 c4 13. Bxc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 Qxc4 15. bxc4 Nd7 16. Rab1 Ra7 17. Nd1 Rc7 18. Ne3 a5 19.

"White dreams of promoting his a pawn, but in the process takes away a vital square from his Bishop.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the move as a mistake because promoting a pawn typically involves advancing it to the eighth rank, which in this case resulted in the loss of a critical square for the Bishop.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d5 Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. O-O a6 10. a4 b6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. b3 c4 13. Bxc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 Qxc4 15. bxc4 Nd7 16. Rab1 Ra7 17. Nd1 Rc7 18. Ne3 a5 19.

35.exd5?? Nxd5 and White loses a minor piece.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the blunder of losing a minor piece after 35.exd5?? Nxd5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6.

Thusly freeing my King.,True,"
The comment ""Thusly freeing my King"" suggests that the player mistakenly moved their King into a position that allowed it to be captured, thus committing a blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4.
