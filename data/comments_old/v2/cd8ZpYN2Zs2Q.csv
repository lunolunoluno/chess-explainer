"Capablanca goes his own way, avoiding book lines in so far as they existed. 4...",True,"

The comment suggests that the player, Capablanca, opted for an unconventional or non-standard move, deviating from established strategies or ""book lines,"" which implies the move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3,"This is a game between Capablanca, J. (as White) and White, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"," White plays Knight to f3, leading Black into a suboptimal position."
Very enterprising.,False,"

The comment ""Very enterprising"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move was bold or aggressive, rather than indicating an error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bc3 Re8 8. Be2 d6,"This is a game between Capablanca, J. (as White) and White, J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6",-
"Capablanca was not one to refuse a challenge. He could castle instead, with a defensible game but not much more. 10...",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because it only suggests an alternative move without explaining why the previous move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6.

"Black has a small material advantage, but his game is not easy because he will be much harassed by White's extra pieces.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the material disadvantage but points out the potential difficulties the player will face due to the opponent's extra pieces.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bc3 Re8 8. Be2 d6 9. exd6 Bxe3 10. fxe3 Nxe3 11. Qd2 Nxc4 12. Qg5 f6 13. Qd5+ Be6 14. Qd3 Nxd6 15. O-O Bc4 16. Qxc4+ Nxc4 17. Bxc4+ Kh8 18.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to d6"," Black has a small material advantage, but their game is challenging due to White's additional pieces causing significant pressure."
"Black correctly advances his pawn majority. It would be absurd, for instance, to attempt a king's side attack against White's many pieces.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it praises the strategic move of advancing the pawn majority, instead of pointing out the error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bc3 Re8 8. Be2 d6 9. exd6 Bxe3 10. fxe3 Nxe3 11. Qd2 Nxc4 12. Qg5 f6 13. Qd5+ Be6 14. Qd3 Nxd6 15. O-O Bc4 16. Qxc4+ Nxc4 17. Bxc4+ Kh8 18. Nbd2 Qd6 19. Kh1 Rad8 20.

"White makes room for his king, and Black does the same. This was the kind of chance that White was waiting for, because he now has chances of a king's side attack. Fron his point fo view the disparity of four pieces against two is at an optimum: had he not excanged some pieces the ratio would have been favourable, whilst if he were now to exchange rooks he would hardly have a sufficient attacking force.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it analyzes the strategic implications of the move in the context of creating opportunities for a king-side attack, considering the exchange of pieces and its impact on the game's balance.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4.

From White's perspective, this move was not optimal. The balance of power had shifted unfavorably; White now had to contend with a four-to-two material disadvantage. This situation was not ideal, as it could have been worse. Had White not initiated an exchange of pieces, the material ratio would have been more favorable. However, if White were to proceed with exchanging rooks, it's doubtful that they would have maintained a decisive attack."
Black sets a trap but opens more pockets for White's pieces.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that while Black attempted to lure White into a trap, it also created additional opportunities for White's pieces.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bc3 Re8 8. Be2 d6 9. exd6 Bxe3 10. fxe3 Nxe3 11. Qd2 Nxc4 12. Qg5 f6 13. Qd5+ Be6 14. Qd3 Nxd6 15. O-O Bc4 16. Qxc4+ Nxc4 17. Bxc4+ Kh8 18. Nbd2 Qd6 19. Kh1 Rad8 20.

At the critical point of the game Black changes plan.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only describes Black changing their strategy, not the error in their previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4.

"Now Black's only advantage, the queen's side pawn majority, disappears; and White winds up with a slendid finish, the minor pieces crowding out the queen:",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the loss of Black's advantage and describing White's improved position, which effectively crowds out Black's queen.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bc3 Re8 8. Be2 d6 9. exd6 Bxe3 10. fxe3 Nxe3 11. Qd2 Nxc4 12. Qg5 f6 13. Qd5+ Be6 14. Qd3 Nxd6 15. O-O Bc4 16. Qxc4+ Nxc4 17. Bxc4+ Kh8 18. Nbd2 Qd6 19. Kh1 Rad8 20.

"When we see a game of this quality, against a high-ranking national player, we have to rub our eyes and to remember that it was played simultaneously alongside twenty-seven other games. Capablanca is reported to have played 240 moves in the first half-hour, and in the later stages of this game Black had some difficulty contending against Capablanca's fantastic speed of play.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it rather provides context regarding the game's intensity and Capablanca's rapid play, which doesn't directly address the player's error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4.
