O-O Nf6,"This is a game between Canal, E. (as White) and Alekhine, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6", 'Alekhine's N367 is not as favorable as Nd6 for Black.'
"Black is now carrying out an attacking theme against White's kingside, but he is very cautious. The following push f5-f4, which looks like a blocking one, would not get anything since White would easily obtain a dissolution of the pieces. Absolutely secure on that side, by putting the Rooks on the second rank he could take the initiative on the queenside, surely with advtantage. He would be well supported by the Rooks which can carry out a double task, defense on one side, attack on the other side.",True,"

By pushing the pawn to f5, Black is overlooking an opportunity to challenge White's central control. Instead of creating a solid defense, Black's move would allow White to gain a powerful position on the queenside with both Rooks ready to support the advance. White's pieces are already set up to dominate the game, and Black's move doesn't contribute to their strategy."
"At this point Black is in the embarassment of the continuation of the attack: push the pawns on the kingside against the White castle is a very dangerous maneuver... But his tricks are inexhaustible, and he is already manoeuvring for the possession of the e3 square, where he wants to place his Knight which, after the Rook a8 has come in action in e8 or f8, would give him a very good position.",True,"

This comment does accurately describe the potential mistake made by the player, as pushing the pawns on the kingside against the White castle can be a risky move if it exposes the king and allows for counterplay.

"?? - In order to explain this hallucination it is useful to let the reader know the conditions where this game was played. It began at Caffe' Nazionale, was interrupted at 2 hours in the morning and resumed at 2.45 at the Hotel Fioramonti where Alekhine wa lodged. At about 6 o'clock (it was dawn already) we were at this point when, sure that nothing could have changed the fate of this game, I let myself fall asleep: in fact I played the move 81.Ke5convinced that I had played Kxd5 (after 81...c4 the game is draw). The astonish ment of my opponent recalled me to reality. By now the game is lost.",True,"

Last move played: White plays King to e5"," It's crucial to clarify that Alekhine's move 81. Ke5 was a strategic blunder. By choosing to check with the King while the opponent's rook is still on the d-file, Alekhine, as Black, missed the opportunity to exploit White's premature attack. A more solid move would have been 81... Qxd5, which would have not only counterattacked White's position but also maintained balance on the board, leaving Alekhine to consider a draw. This oversight demonstrates a lapse in tactical foresight, crucial in competitive chess."
