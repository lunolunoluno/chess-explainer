Nf3 e6 3. Bd3,"This is a game between Flockhart, H. (as White) and Jessing, M. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3",-

I felt it was the only move to prevent WQ going to g4 or h5. It meant BQ side castling likely.,True,"

Room for King. I was concerned about Na4 or a4 for W and the sacrifice of the WB at a6.,True,"
