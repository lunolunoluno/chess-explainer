"The well-known ""struggle for the tempo."" After 8. Bd3 dc4, Black gains a tempo, and hence white delays the development of his Bishop on f1.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that Black's move has created a tempo advantage, as it forces White to waste a move developing the Bishop instead of preparing for the central battle.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3," Euwe's move to a3 is a mistake, as it allows Black to gain a tempo by developing a piece."
the struggle for the tempo continues.,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a move that allowed the opponent to gain a tempo advantage, suggesting a mistake in positioning or strategy.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3," Black's attempt to regain momentum with Pawn to h3 was a misstep, as it fails to pose any real threat or challenge to White's position."
Black could have continued the struggle with 10...Re8 when 11 Qc2 is best.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as 11 Qc2 is indeed the stronger move for Black.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on c4," White's move with Qc2 is not ideal. Instead of playing 10...Re8, Black should have continued with 10...Be7, securing the king's safety and preparing for castling. Qc2 doesn't address the immediate threats effectively."
(12... c5 is less good because of 13. d5),True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because 13. d5 directly challenges the c5 pawn and gains space in the center, forcing Black to make a decision that can lead to a disadvantageous position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b7," The move 12...c5 is not advisable, as White's 13.d5 secures a strong central presence."
(13. b4 allows counterplay with 13... a5),True,"
The comment correctly identifies the issue by highlighting the unnecessary pawn move, which weakens the pawn structure and opens up the possibility for the opponent to counterattack with...a5.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle," ""White's play, 13. b4, is considered suboptimal as it weakens their pawn structure and doesn't contribute to their positional strategy."""
"This releases the tension in the centre. A dubious idea in this position. This gives Black a queenside majority, which in the event of an ending might decide the game in his favour. But white gets a free hand in the centre which will prove dangerous in the middlegame.",True,"

The comment correctly evaluates the move as a mistake, pointing out the trade-offs between a potential queenside majority for Black and a dominant center for White in the middlegame.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c4," This move doesn't effectively relieve the central tension. It may offer Black a queenside majority advantage, which could be significant in an endgame scenario. However, White gains a strong center position that could pose threats as the game progresses into the middlegame."
"Probably the decisive mistake, since white's attack becomes more powerful than ever. This move allows white to put a pawn on e5, a very important pre-requisite for an attack, without much grave a weakness. Had white been forced to push e4-e5, his pawn at d4 becomes a terrible weakness.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the strategic advantage gained by the opponent and the potential weakness it creates for the player's pawn structure.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e5," It seems like a critical error occurred, as White's offensive potential has significantly increased. This move did not create any serious weakness for White. If White had been compelled to play e4-e5, it would have created a vulnerable pawn on d4."
"Now a central file is opened up which, white is better placed to benefit from.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of opening the central file, which benefits White, indicating an understanding of the strategic importance of central control.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on e5," White's Pawn captures on e5 opens up the central file, but this move might not be the best strategic decision for White, as Black could take advantage of the newly opened lines."
Forced. Bad would be (17... Nd5 18. Qc2) (17... Nd7 18. Qg4 Kh8 19. Qh5 when Qf7 and Bh6 are both threatened.),True,. The comment accurately explains the mistake by providing alternative moves that would have been better options for the player.,1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to h7," In this situation, White has a forced move. Opting for (17... Nd5) would allow Black to play (18. Qc2), which is not favorable for White. Alternatively, (17... Nd7) followed by (18. Qg4) and then (19. Qh5) could lead to Black threatening with (Qf7) and (Bh6), creating a challenging scenario for White."
threatening to win a pawn by Bh7+ and Qf7. Also possible was (18. Qg4 Bg5 19.Rcd1 {And then Bg3 and f4.),True,"

The comment explains the strategic mistake by pointing out a better move (Bh7+), which not only poses a threat to win a pawn but also leads to a series of moves that can improve the position and create difficulties for the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h5," White's last move, Queen to h5, poses a significant threat. Black can respond with Bh7+, followed by Qf7, aiming to win a pawn. An alternative move sequence is 18. Qg4, followed by Bg5 and Rcd1, setting up a fork with Bg3 and f4. Both scenarios highlight the aggressive nature of White's position."
This sacrifice is based on positional considerations. White obtains only two pawns for the piece but Black's king is exposed and white enjoys a long term initiative.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, highlighting that the sacrifice was positionally motivated and focusing on long-term initiative benefits despite the immediate material loss.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20. Bxh6,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on h6," 'White's decision to sacrifice the bishop was due to positional advantages. They gain two pawns, but Black's king becomes vulnerable, allowing White to maintain an initiative for the future.'"
forced. Declining the piece with (20... g6 21. Qg4 Qxe5 22. e4!leaves white with a powerful attack.),True,"
The comment explains the mistake made as it outlines a better alternative for the player that results in a strong attack for White.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20.

Qg4 Qxe5 22. e4! would allow White to establish a strong position.)'
The correct way. Wrong would be (21. Qxh6 Rad8 when black is out of danger.),True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake in the move, suggesting a better alternative for the white player to avoid putting the rook at risk.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20. Bxh6 gxh6 21. Rd4,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to d4," 'Black's move is not appropriate. A better choice would be Qxh6, which would put the opponent's rook in check."
If (21... Bg5 22. h4 Qxe5 23. hxg5 hxg5 24. Rg4 {the attack still continues.),True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by outlining a sequence of moves that allows White to maintain pressure and continue attacking, showing that the player's move did not maintain a strong position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20. Bxh6 gxh6 21. Rd4 f5,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5," In this sequence, we observe a critical error made by Black. After 21... Bg5, White responds with 22. h4. This pawn move by White undermines their own king's safety by preparing for h5, but it fails to immediately challenge Black's bishop. Consequently, Black captures the pawn on h4 with 22... Qxe5. White then proceeds to capture on g5 with 23. hxg5. This exchange weakens White's pawn structure, opening lines that could be advantageous for Black in the long run. Black recaptures with 24.... hxg5, maintaining pawn structure but giving Black a central presence. White's next move, 24. Rg4, suggests an attempt to maintain pressure, but it significantly overlooks the structural advantage Black has gained."
this is the position Euwe had in his mind when he sacrificed the bishop. The evaluation of the position depends on the comparative mobility of the pieces. Black's Knight on e8 and Bishop on g7 can not move and he'll require some time to mobilize both his rooks.,True,"

The comment identifies a common mistake made in chess, which is underestimating the mobility of pieces in their current positions, leading to the sacrifice without seeing the consequences.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20. Bxh6 gxh6 21. Rd4 f5 22. exf6 Bxf6 23. Rg4+ Bg7 24. Qxh6,This is a game between Euwe (as White) and Maroczy (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on h6," In this position, White's sacrifice of the bishop was not advantageous. The position's evaluation is heavily reliant on the mobility of the pieces. Black's Knight on e8 and Bishop on g7 are immobile, and it will take some time for Black to mobilize both their rooks."
beautiful! The knight is heading for h5.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not mention any specific error or provide reasoning behind the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6.

In order to drive the white queen with ...Rd6 or ...Re6,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by suggesting a direct attack on the white queen, which indicates the player's intention was to pressure a valuable piece.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6 8. a3 h6 9. Bf4 a6 10. h3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Ne5 c4 15. Bb1 Re8 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nh7 18. Qh5 Nf8 19. Rcd1 Qc7 20. Bxh6 gxh6 21.

(26...Rd6?? 27. Rxg7+ Qxg7 28. Qxg7+ Kxg7 29. Nf5+),True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player as it leads to a loss of material without adequate compensation.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to e6," 'The move 26...Rd6 by Black results in a blunder. White responds with 27. Rxg7+, forcing Black's queen to capture on g7. Black's loss of the queen with 27...Qxg7? allows White to play 28. Qxg7+, putting Black's king in check. A forced move for Black would be 28...Kxg7. However, Black delivers a check with 28...Nf5+, and White captures with 29. Nxf5, gaining a material advantage with White being up a knight. This sequence of moves shows a critical oversight by Black.'"
Now black's position appears well secured. He has effectively mobilized his rooks and apparently fend off the attack. But Euwe has something up his sleeve.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake but fails to explicitly state what the mistake was, leaving the reader to infer Euwe's impending strategy.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.

"Decisive! Euwe must have seen this many moves earlier. When the attack with only pieces comes to a standstill, White manages to stimulate the attack with the help of the h-pawn. The threat being Qg5 and h5 winning a piece, which is very difficult to parry.",True,"
