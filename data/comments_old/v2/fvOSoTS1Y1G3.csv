"With the idea of recycling the Knight with Nb8-c6 to attack the Pd4 or to force the exchange with the Knight in e5, believing that in such a way the position will improve.",True,"

Last move played: Black plays Knight to b8"," Black's recent move to reposition the Knight to c6 is questionable. Their strategy seems to focus on attacking the White's pawn on d4 or exchanging the Knight on e5, with the belief that this could lead to a more favorable position. However, this move might not be the best choice, as it doesn't directly contribute to White's position or create immediate pressure."
"? - Levenfish, in the Tournament book, wrote: ""Illogical move. It was necessary to continue with Nb8-c6 in agreement with the prepared plan. Probably White would have replied with Rad1 and only now g7-g6 would have been good, with the reply Bd3-b1. Probably, against some other Master, the same position could have been reached by move transposition, but against Panov, brilliant attacking player, the move in the text is a mistake. The early castle weakening gives White the idea for a combination.""",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the logical error in the move and provides insight into the consequences and alternatives that were overlooked.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

Instead, White opted for Rad1, which led to g7-g6 by Black. This move weakens White's position and could have been avoided. Against a player like Black, who is known for aggressive play, this choice was not advisable."
