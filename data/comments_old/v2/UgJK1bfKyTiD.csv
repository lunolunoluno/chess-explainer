One of the main continuations of the four knights variation.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it refers to a continuation rather than the specific error in the move.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5,"This is a game between Lupini, S.. (as White) and Enev, Zlatko (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5",-
"So far both players have followed strictly the main line of the variation. Black is the first to deviate in a less practised continuation. Here usually 11. ... Nd4 is played. I found the variants there too sharp and insecure to my taste so I chose the move in the game which seemed a bit ""calmer"".",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it acknowledges the deviation from the main line of the variation and provides a personal preference for a ""calmer"" move that was chosen instead.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7,"This is a game between Lupini, S.. (as White) and Enev, Zlatko (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7"," The comment, simplified, reads: ""In this game, White (S..) and Black (Zlatko) adhered to the main line until Black's (Zlatko) first deviation from the less common continuation. Typically, Black (Zlatko) plays 11...Nd4, but this move can lead to risky positions. White (S..) opted for a move that they felt was more secure and less aggressive."""
threatening 14.Nc5,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a mistake by explaining a potential tactical threat that the opponent could have capitalized on, which indicates that the player missed a critical opportunity to put the opponent's king in check.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2,"This is a game between Lupini, S.. (as White) and Enev, Zlatko (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2", Black's last move has put White at a disadvantage. The threat of 14.Nc5 was not executed because White has missed an opportunity to capture Black's pawn on e6.
! The strongest answer. Other responses have been tried here also but with less success:,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, it actually praises the move as the strongest answer.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7.

"? The first move deviating from known examples and ... a serious mistake. White is obliged here to sharpen the game by means of 16.d4, although this is pretty risky too, e. g.:",True,"

The comment appropriately critiques the player's deviation from conventional moves and highlights a potential serious mistake, suggesting the necessity of a more aggressive pawn move with 16.d4.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2 b6 14. Bb2 a5 15. b5 Na7 16. a4,"This is a game between Lupini, S.. (as White) and Enev, Zlatko (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a4"," White's first move deviates from standard theory, which is a significant error. They should consider playing 16.d4 to enhance the game, despite the potential risks involved."
The plan s tarted with this move wasn't all clear to me at that very moment. I somehow felt I must be pushing on the queen side and in the center but did not yet see any exact goals. I was lucky to find a relatively straightforward way to win anyway. Now for the plan: black tries to occupy d4 with a piece (preferably knight) and to take the control over the opened c-file. At the same time the weak a4-pawn is constantly being threatened so white is kept busy. Black does not avoid exchanges since even with relatively few peaces the control of the opened line and the penetration with the rook on the seventh rank bring easily serious advantages.,False,"

The comment does not directly address the specific mistake made by the player but instead explains a possible plan for the opponent's strategy.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2 b6 14. Bb2 a5 15. b5 Na7 16. a4 c6 17. bxc6 Nxc6 18.

"Now black seizes the control over the opened line though a series of forced changes. It is difficult, however, to see some better move for white at this point.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it mentions that black has gained control over the opened line, which implies that the player made a move that allowed black to do so, but also acknowledges that finding a better move for white at that point is challenging.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2 b6 14. Bb2 a5 15. b5 Na7 16. a4 c6 17. bxc6 Nxc6 18. Rbc1 Ndb4 19.

Last move played: White plays Knight to b5"," After Black's knight move to b5, White finds themselves in a challenging position. They must navigate the forced changes in the game carefully to avoid placing themselves at a disadvantage."
! Now white is lost. Less convincing was the attempt to push further on the queen side:,True,"

The comment indeed explains the mistake, as it suggests that the move made by the white player weakened their position significantly, potentially leading to a loss.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2 b6 14. Bb2 a5 15. b5 Na7 16. a4 c6 17. bxc6 Nxc6 18. Rbc1 Ndb4 19. Qd2 Rfd8 20.

Now the white knight is being shut out of the game but 33.Nd6+ was no good either:,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as the move 33.Nd6+ would have allowed the black bishop to capture the knight and gain a significant advantage.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1 f6 11. d3 Qd7 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Qc2 b6 14. Bb2 a5 15. b5 Na7 16. a4 c6 17. bxc6 Nxc6 18. Rbc1 Ndb4 19.
