"While this is an English Opening, it has many characteristics of the Grunfeld Defense. This moves avoids d4 inviting the Grunfeld. Qb3",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move Qb3 is a common response against the Grunfeld Defense to avoid the d4 pawn push.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3," This move by White, playing Pawn to g3, is not beneficial as it weakens the pawn structure and does not contribute to central control or development."
/\Nb6 is more natural in these English positions. One thing the exchange does is weaken Black's grip of the center.,True,"

The comment appropriately explains the mistake by highlighting that the move weakens Black's control of the center, which is generally a strategic disadvantage in English positions.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on c3, Black's move by moving their knight to c3 was a questionable decision. This action weakens Black's control over the center of the board.
O-O Ba3 An old Russian idea. This works in the Grunfeld but not here. 0-0,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it criticizes the move for not being suitable in the current position and referencing a common opening idea.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g2, The move Ba3 by Black wasn't effective. This tactic is known in the Grunfeld but doesn't apply here. The move 0-0 was played by White.
Black is suffering from an optical illusion. The illusion is that the b pawn is free if you move the Queen Bishop. Here is the (+)truth[+] 11..Be6 12. Qxb7?? Rfc1 13.Ng5 Rab8 and the White Queen leaves the board. Keep alert to tactical possibilities.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it incorrectly suggests a tactical possibility rather than pinpointing the actual error in the move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b8,-
"Qd1 Rfd8 Passing on the creation of the isolated d-pawn (/\cxd4) is good here. It shows mature thought, even if it was not intentional. We all learn to automatically filter some things by instinct. This is a time saver but must be deliberately challenged. In this filtering process we develop bias such as (+)labels.[+] (e.g. ethnic and religious affiliations) These tend to put blinders on us. In chess, the basic teacher develops a set of rules and presents them in lessons. This system of indoctrinating the student is good because they must be understood since violating them means terrible consequences. Having come to understand the basic filters and biases we then learn to develop (+)exceptions[+] and deeper understandings. It is the difference between following the Law and living by the Spirit. One such 'law' in chess is that the isolated pawn is a (+)bad[+] thing. Typically, if you know how to handle the position, the isolated pawn can be difficult from either perspective. The fact that you either intentionally passed on this idea or unintentionally filtered the idea shows good potential. If it was an unintentional filter then you must focus energy on questioning these filters.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the importance of not automatically dismissing the creation of an isolated pawn and encouraging the player to challenge their instinctual bias towards isolated pawns in chess.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6," The player played a move that intentionally or unintentionally ignored a potential weakness, specifically the isolated d-pawn. By choosing not to address this issue, they demonstrated mature strategic thinking, even if it wasn't a deliberate decision. This kind of move often requires a deeper analysis to understand its implications. It's essential for players to be aware of these strategic considerations to avoid falling into common pitfalls in the game."
Rfd1 Bc4,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move ""Rfd1"" allows the opponent's bishop to attack the rook, potentially leading to a loss of the rook.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5," White's Rfd1 move is questionable, as it does not contribute to any immediate strategic advantage and could potentially weaken their position by blocking the f1-square and the bishop's diagonal. Black's Bc4 continues to develop pieces efficiently and maintains pressure on White's center."
Lack of judgment. There is a time to become materialistic. Material is one of the most permanent and decisive imbalances. Taking the pawn with /\Nxa2 should have given you the game. At least this move does not lose.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, highlighting the lack of material gain and the missed opportunity to take the opponent's pawn with the knight, which could have significantly improved the position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 12. Qc2 Qb6 13. Ng5 cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Qe4 a5,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a5," The move made by Black by advancing their pawn to a5 was a significant error. This decision led to a substantial material disadvantage, which could have been crucial in the game's outcome. Ideally, capturing the pawn on a2 with their knight would have secured a material gain for Black."
"Nd5 This is your (+)losing move.[+] There is a fine line between a (+)great[+] player and a (+)good[+] player. Several distinguishing characteristics are important to note at this point. For instance the (+)great[+] player has in reserve a larger number of recognized positions (and the tricks that go with them). A (+)great[+] player also has the sense of when the position is critical. This is such a moment. Normally, I'd rail on this move but you had the courage to send in the game and learn something useful. Getting back to the idea of material, I like taking at a2. An interesting idea is /\Bd3. Once again, protecting the pawn is an illusion. Notice 23/\Bxa2 23.Qxe7 Rb7 24.Qe4 f5 and once again the Queen gets to watch from the side of the board. This Knight, in this position, loses effective influence on the center. Ne5 Nf6 Qf4",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the loss of material and the ineffective influence of the knight on the center, ultimately leading to a disadvantageous position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 12. Qc2 Qb6 13. Ng5 cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Qe4 a5 16. h4 h6 17. Nf3,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3," This move is considered a poor choice. A skilled player would have a more robust repertoire of positions and a better sense of when a position is critical. Taking a2 might seem protective, but it's really an illusion. The move /Bd3 presents an interesting alternative, but the Knight loses its central influence after the sequence: 23/Bxa2 23.Qxe7 Rb7 24.Qe4 f5, after which the Queen becomes a spectator."
"Rd2 Nd7 L esson number four: play with a plan! d5 Qf6 White chokes and gives Black the game (again) but this follow up mistake to 22/\Nd5 returns the favor. White gains a Rook, a Knight, a Bishop, and spare change for the Queen with 22/ \Qxe5. Remember the (+)law[+] we talked about earlier? One of the lesson/laws we preach is (+) protect the Queen at all costs.[+] The trouble is that it is more important to protect the King! If you count material, you will find that Black gains material on the exchange. Nc6",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the need to protect the Queen and the importance of protecting the King, which the player failed to do in their move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 12. Qc2 Qb6 13. Ng5 cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Qe4 a5 16. h4 h6 17. Nf3 Rc8 18. g4 Qe6,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e6," White played a poor move (22. Nd5) after Black's (Black's) Qf6. This mistake allowed Black to recapture with their Queen, gaining material and advantage (Nc6). White lost a Rook, Knight, Bishop, and part of their Queen's value. Remember the principle of (+) protecting the Queen, but prioritize the King's safety."
Ne7 Kh7 ef4 Bb2 Rb2 Rc5 Nc6 Re8 Rd2 Nf6 Try 33/\Re2. If you are going to fight at least don't make it easy for your opponent. d6 White's pawn = space + possibilities! Be6,True,"

The comment explains that the move played by Black does not pose an immediate threat to White and should be followed up with a move that creates challenges for White, as it allows White to gain more space and possibilities on the board.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 12. Qc2 Qb6 13. Ng5 cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Qe4 a5 16. h4 h6 17. Nf3 Rc8 18. g4 Qe6 19. Qf4,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to f4," 'After Black's Ne7 move, White's e4 pawn was threatened. White's e4 pawn could be a strong central piece, but its position becomes vulnerable. White's pawn can potentially give space and open up possibilities, but in this case, the pawn's move is not tactically sound. Instead of playing Re2, White should consider Be6, which helps in developing a piece and controlling the center, while also preparing for castling.'"
"Nd7 Na5 Rec8 Coach's advice: For courage in allowing me to examine a lost game A+! This shows a desire to actually correct faulty thinking processes. (If only I could have your thoughts as you were thinking them/\..) So some ideas/\/\ Challenge your filters. You seem to be unwilling to grab the pawn when it was available but unwilling to give up the pawn for a greater good (winning the Queen). Start paying attention to these filters and force yourself to look beyond these (+)laws[+] you have learned. The truth is on the board, not on a set of learned rules. You show good positional judgment but do not seem to have good attacking skills. The problem with good positional judgment is that if you focus here, it is not enough to win! Somewhere you must attack, even if it is (+)pawn picking.[+] I'd suggest that you develop a (+)catalogue of positions. [+] To do this get some cards or a notebook where you will record positions for games you play or see. Somewhere keep a (+)key[+] on the correct moves by category. Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe topics would include (+) sacrifice[+], (+)pawns[+], (+)king safety.[+] Don't buy a book! You must do the work yourself, if a position strikes you enough for you to take the time to record it then you are more likely to learn it for yourself. I see that you are a (+)club[+] player. Clubs are fun and often good chess but/\.. The tendency is to play (+)cat and mouse[+] games with the other players minds. I'd suggest that you settle into three systems (two with Black and one with White) and play them regardless of who you play and what your opponent played last time. Here is the trick. You opponents will prepare for you, since you will be predictable, and will find the most difficult lines for you. That is good, they will test you and force you to grow and develop good lines. It will also force you to be precise in your opening moves. The idea is that you will have three openings that you know as well as anyone in the world and can play in any circumstance. Nb3",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting their inability to recognize the importance of attacking even when in a seemingly good position, suggesting they focus more on developing a catalogue of positions and learning from each game, which would help them improve their attacking skills.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Rb8 9. d4 Be6 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 12. Qc2 Qb6 13. Ng5 cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Qe4 a5 16. h4 h6 17. Nf3 Rc8 18. g4 Qe6 19. Qf4 g5,This is a game between W52 (as White) and B52 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5," 'White played Nd7, a move that does not contribute to the advancement of their position. The coach advised White to challenge their own filters and pay attention to the board beyond the rules they've learned. It's noted that White shows good positional judgment but lacks attacking skills. The suggestion is to develop a catalog of positions by recording games, focusing on key topics like sacrifices, pawn structure, and king safety. By adhering to a set of standardized systems with Black and White, White can improve predictability and precision. The current Nd7 move does not align with this approach, and it's essential for White to adapt and learn from each game played.'"
