Kasparov had a fondness for this system of Petrosian's in the 1980s.,False,"

The comment refers to a historical chess system and doesn't explain the specific mistake made by the player in the given move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3",-
This method of seeking early exchanges is distinctly dubious.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it directly addresses the strategy of seeking early exchanges, which is the player's objective that led to the loss.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4", Black's knight move to e4 is considered ill-advised.
"From a strategical standpoint, this move refutes Black's opening. Now Black can retreat with 7...Bb7 but after 8.e4, White has a distinct positional advantage.",True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake by highlighting the strategic disadvantage created by the move, which allows Black to easily retreat with a less aggressive position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"," 'Playing Knight to d2 as White is strategically unsound. Black now has the option to retreat with Bishop to b7, but after White plays pawn to e4, White gains a clear positional edge.'"
"Now that the Black bishop has departed from the h1-a8 diagonal, Kasparov takes it for himself.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it only states that Kasparov takes the bishop when it has moved.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3",-
"It would seem more appropriate to play 8...c6 9.Bg2 d5, but after 10.0-0, White has the freer and easier game to play.",True,"

The comment correctly explains that the player missed the opportunity to prepare for Black's pawn break with...c6 and the bishop's positioning with Bg2, which would have helped White to maintain control and a more comfortable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"," Playing 8...c6 followed by 9.Bg2 d5 appears to be a solid approach for Black, aiming to challenge White's center. However, after White castles with 10.0-0, Black's position becomes less favorable, allowing White to enjoy more space and a smoother path to initiate their strategy."
"Andersson seeks counterplay with b6-b5, but his lag in development is a cause for concern.",True,"

The annotation correctly points out the player's mistake in lagging behind in development while attempting to create counterplay.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6", 'Andersson's attempt at counterplay with b6-b5 could be problematic due to their slower piece development.'
"After 10...d5 11.Bb2 Be7 12.Rc1 Qd7 13.Bg2 0-0 14.cxd5 exd5 15.Qb3, White has a clear advantage.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as White gains a clear advantage after Black's 15...exd5, which allows White to dominate the center and develop their pieces effectively.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"," After these moves, the position isn't particularly strong for White. White's last move, Qb3, has not been a particularly strong play in this context, as it exposes the queen to potential threats without immediate compensation."
"Ulf Andersson has a reputation for being a very patient and solid defender, and thus a very difficult man to beat. This retreat of the knight has a view to the maneuver Na7-c8, followed by d7-d5 and Nc8-d6-c4. But White has some moves first!",True,"

The comment correctly identifies a mistake by Ulf Andersson, explaining the potential maneuver and acknowledging White's possible moves, which contribute to understanding the strategic context.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a7"," 'Andersson, the Black player, is known for their patience and solid defense. The retreat of the knight to a7 is part of their strategy to reach the maneuver Na7-c8, proceeding with d7-d5 and Nc8-d6-c4. However, White has options available that could counter this.'"
"Exploiting the misplaced ""Queen's Indian bishop. """,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a potential mistake by referring to a common trap involving the move of the Queen's Indian bishop.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to h4"," The move played by White neglected the positioning of their Queen's Indian bishop, which could be a tactical error."
Better was 13...h5.,True,"

The comment accurately points out that the previous move was a mistake and suggests a better alternative, h5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"," ""13...h5 is not ideal."""
A strong positional pawn sacrifice that opens the long diagonal for White's dark-squared bishop.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out a potential strategic advantage gained from the pawn sacrifice, which could have been a deliberate sacrifice rather than an error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"," White's last move, advancing their pawn to d5, led to a weakening of their own position by overextending their pawn structure. This move also left their dark-squared bishop vulnerable and opened up their long diagonal for Black's counterplay."
"White's compensation for his pawn is enormous - a massive lead in development, two raking bishops, and a weakness on g7 that prevents Black catching up in development in a normal manner.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by the player, explaining the consequences of the pawn sacrifice in terms of development advantage and positional weakness.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"," 'White's compensation for their pawn's advance is not as significant as it seems. While they may have a lead in development and two strong bishops, the opening play has created a vulnerability on g7. This vulnerability limits how Black can develop effectively, making it challenging for them to catch up under normal play conditions.'"
"The target is the Black king, with the e3-e4 break scheduled.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates an oversight of the position where the King is a target and the upcoming e3-e4 pawn move is critical for a potential attack.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O f6 17. Re1,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1", Playing Rook to e1 is a poor move by Black as it weakens their kingside and exposes the king to potential attacks.
"Now after the inevitable exchange of light-squared bishops, White will have the g6-square at his disposal as an invasion point for his queen.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12.

Now there are all manner of tactics brewing against the f6 and g7 points in the Black position.,True,"

"Hoping to muster a ""second rank defense ""with Ra8-a7. Losing alternatives included 22...Rf8 23.Rad1 d5 24.Nxf6! when mate is unavoidable, and 22...Re8 23.Qg6+ Kf8, when in his notes, Kasparov gives 24.g4! with the idea of Ne4-g3-f5 as winning. While this is adequate, I analyzed the following forcing continuation: 24.Ng5! hxg5 25.h6 gxh6 26.Qxh6+ Kf7 (or 26...Kg8 27.Qg6+ Kf8 (27...Kh8 28.Kg2!) 28.Kg2! - a ""quiet ""move when Black cannot unravel in time to meet the threat of Re1-h1-h8+.) 27.Qh7+ Kf8 28.Kg2! and now: a) 28...Bd6 29.Qh8+ Kf7 30.Rxe8 Qae8 31.Qxf6+ Kg8 32.Qg7 mate; b) 28...Nc8 29.Qg6 Nd6 29.Rh1 Nf7 30.Rh7, winning; c) 28...d5 29.Bd4! c5 30.Qg6! cxd4 31.Rh1 Bd6 32.Rh7!

Instead, White risks losing the game with several alternative moves. One such alternative is 22...Rf8 followed by 23.Rad1 and d5, which leads to a loss. Another option 22...Re8 followed by 23.Qg6+ Kf8 allows Black to play Ne4-g3-f5, which White can counter with 24.g4. However, White's analysis goes deeper with 24.Ng5, leading to a forced sequence. The move hxg5 followed by 25.h6 gxh6 results in a check with Qxh6, forcing Black's king to move. The subsequent move 27.Qh7+ forces Black's king to f7. A quiet move, 28.Kg2, still leaves Black with several losing options, such as 28...Bd6 followed by 29.Qh8+ Kf7 and 30.Rxe8 Qae8, leading to mate. Alternatively, Black can play "
