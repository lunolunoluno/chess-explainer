It's no ""Deep Thought"", but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test their program against it!",True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the consequences of the move, stating that Black gets a significant advantage, and mentioning the ongoing analysis by human and computer chess experts.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Valvo points out that despite Mephisto's success, it's not on par with Deep Thought, but it's still a significant achievement for AI in chess.'"
"Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side. And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece on d6. Kasparov now ""hangs"" his head between his hands. A very typical posture for the WC.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the consequences of White's weakened pawn structure and the potential advantage it gives to Black's position, as well as the psychological impact on White indicated by the described posture.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4. Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests potential counter-moves (Nb6-a4 and Qa5-a4) that the opponent could execute in response to the poor position of White.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"Time: AK: 1:31 GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still under pressure, but improving. Mephisto ""thinks"" it's slightly better for Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not Nd7-b6.",True,"

Maybe ...Nc3 should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17. If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame double-bishop ending. Draw.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that the player lost their advantage, suggesting that a different move, possibly Be3-c1, would have helped maintain the pressure on Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Last move played: White plays King to g2"," Tisdall comments that Garry (Black) may have dropped his lead. Their move might have been hasty, leading to the current shift in dynamics. Karpov (White)'s strategy to advance f2-f4, aiming for a potential endgame advantage, might be thwarted by Black responding with Re8-e1, which could lead to a more balanced position. The time spent by each player, with Karpov at 1:46 and Black at 1:17, also suggests an urgent need for Karpov to regroup and reassess the situation."
"Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is too close.",True,"

The comment provides a detailed analysis of the board position, highlighting the potential weaknesses in Black's position and the limited effectiveness of White's d-pawn, which confirms that Black is better and the move as a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.
