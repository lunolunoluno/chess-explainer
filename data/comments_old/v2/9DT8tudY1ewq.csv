"A more active continuation than 8.0-0, which was played against me by Kasparov in Amsterdam, 1988. After 8...h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Bxe4, black could have equalized with 10...Nf6!?. But I chose a different plan: 10...0-0 11.c3 e5 (11...Qc7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Qd3 Nf8 14.Re1 b6 15.Ne5 Bb7 16.Qh3, is also better for white, Bellin-Thipsay, England 1987.) 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Re1 exd4 14.Rxe8+ Qxe8 15.Qxd4 Qe7 16.Bf4 Bxf4 17.Qxf4, with a clear positional advantage for white. Another game with Kamsky in the same variation, from Tilburg 1991, continued differently, with 8.c3 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 0-0 11.0-0 c5 (a novelty, earlier 11...e5, which favors white, had been seen) 12.Bc2 (12.dxc5 Bxc5 13.Bc2 Qc7 14.Qe2 Nf6 15.Ne5 Bd6 16.Bf4 b6 17.Rad1 Ba6, with equality) 12...Qc7 13.Re1 Rd8 14.h3 Nf6 15.Qe2 cxd4 16.Nxd4 Bh2+ 17.Kh1 Bf4 18.Nb5 Qb8 19.a4 Bd7 20.Bxf4 Qxf4 21.Nd4 Bc6!, and black solved all problems in the opening. Soon, the game was drawn.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies that the move 8.0-0 was played in response to a variation against Kasparov, and suggests a more active alternative 10...Nf6 (11.c3 e5) which would have equalized the game. The reviewer recognizes the strategic error in opting for a different plan and correctly points out the positional advantage that follows, leading to the game's eventual outcome.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5 Ngf6 6. Bd3 e6 7. N1f3 Bd6 8. Qe2,"This is a game between Kamsky, G (as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"," In this game, White's 10.Bxe4 was a strong move, offering white a clear positional advantage. A possible refined move for Black would have been 10...Nf6!, aiming to equalize the position. However, White chose 10...0-0, leading to a series of moves that consolidated their position further. White's game plan after 11.c3 e5 involved a strategic sequence of moves that continued to build upon their advantage.

Comparing this game with Kamsky's play in Tilburg 1991, White's opening choice with 8.c3 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 led to a different continuation. Black's novelty move 11...c5 challenged White's strategy, although White had equalizing opportunities. The game ultimately reached a draw, showcasing the potential of the variation.

Overall, White's strategy in this game demonstrated tactical and positional strength, with a well-executed sequence of moves that capitalized on their early advantage."
"An attempt to avoid the trade of the knights with 9.Nh3 g5!? 10.Nd2?! Nb6 11.Nb3 Qc7 12.Ng1 Nbd5, led to equality in Borkowski-Sapis (Hradec Kralove, 1987/88), but in this line 10.Nhg1! Qc7 11.Bd2 b6, is interesting, with complex play. The capture on e6 in this situation is not at all dangerous for black: 9.Nxe6 fxe6 10.Bg6+ Ke7 11.0-0 Nf8 12.Bd3 Bd7 13.Ne5 Qe8 14.f4 Kd8 15.c4 Kc7 16.Bd2 Rc8 17.c5 Be7 18.f5 Kb8 19.Rae1 Bd8, and black has a clear advantage (Arnason-Ostenstad, Thorshavn 1987).",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by providing a better alternative move (Nhg1), which leads to complex play and a clear advantage for black, instead of 10.Nd2.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4.

This series led to an equal position in the Borkowski-Sapis game (Hradec Kralove, 1987/88). However, a different move, 10.Nhg1, followed by Qc7 and b6 by Black, presents complex play. Notably, White's 9.Nxe6 move, which seems threatening, isn't dangerous for Black. After capturing on e6 with fxe6, White's 10.Bg6+ Ke7, 11.0-0, and Nf8 by Black, followed by Bd3 by White and c4 by Black, leads to a significant advantage for Black. This advantage is demonstrated by Black's solid position as seen in the Arnason-Ostenstad game (Thorshavn 1987).'"
"If 10.Bxe4 0-0, black later pushes through c6-c5 or e6-e5 with good play.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests that the move 10.Bxe4 is weak because it allows black to counterattack by pushing their pawns through c6-c5 or e6-e5, which could lead to a strong initiative for black.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

"After 10...Qc7 11.Qg4 Kf8 12.0-0, black experienced some difficulties in Gelfand-Speelman (Munich 1992), but he was able to hold the position. Beliavsky recommends the plan with queenside castling (see his notes to Game 23). Recently, a couple of important games concerning this theme were played: Khalifman-Epishin (Dos Hermanas 1993): 10...Qc7 11.Bd2 b6 12.Qg4 Kf8 13.0-0-0 Bb7 14.Rhe1 Rd8 15.Kb1 (not 15.Rxe6 fxe6 16.Nh4 Nf6 17.Qxe6 Qf7!; 15.c4 c5 16.Bc3?! Nf6 17.Qh4 Bxf3 18.gxf3 Bf4+ also gives white nothing.) 15...Nf6 16.Qh4 (no better is 18.Ng4 or 18.Bc3) 16...cxd4 19.g4 (19.Re2 with the initiative is correct) 19...g5 20.Qf2 (20.fxg6 hxg6 21.Qg3 Rhg8 favors black), and now after 20...Rhe8 21.h3 a5?! 22.Re2 Nd5 23.Rde1 Ne3 24.Bxe3 dxe3 25.Qxe3 Qc5 and the players agreed to a draw in an unclear position. They had little time left. Instead of 21...a5?!, 21...Nd5!? gave black a noticeable advantage. Sion Castro-Karpov (Leon 1993): 12...g5! (an important improvement over 12...Kf8) 13.Qh3 Rg8! 14.g4 (after 14.Qh6 Bf8 15.Qh7 Nf6! 16.Qh3 g4 17.Qh4 gxf3 18.Qxf6 fxg2, white maintains equality with 19.Rg1 Qh2 20.0-0-0; 14.Bh7 Rh8 15.Bd3 is also equal) 14...Bb7 15.0-0-0 0-0-0 16.Rhe1 Bf4 17.Kb1 Rh8 18.Bc3 (18.Bxf4 Qxf4 19.Qg3 Qxg3 20.hxg3 c5 is equal) 18...Kb8 19.d5 cxd5 20.Bxh8 Rxh8 21.Nd4 a6 22.Ne6 (if 22.Qf1, 22...Nc5 is strong) 22..fxe6 23.Rxe6 Ne5! 24.Bf5 Nc4 25.Rxh6 Rxh6 26.Qxh6 Qe5 27.Qf8+ Ka7 28.Qb4 Nd2+, and black won quickly.",True," 

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting that black's move 21...a5 was a blunder and that 21...Nd5 would have given black a significant advantage.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5 Ngf6 6. Bd3 e6 7. N1f3 Bd6 8. Qe2 h6 9. Ne4 Nxe4 10. Qxe4 Nf6,"This is a game between Kamsky, G (as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"," After 10...Qc7, Black experienced difficulties, with Beliavsky recommending queenside castling. The game Khalifman-Epishin highlighted a critical mistake from Black with 15...Nf6 16.Qh4, which allowed White to proceed with 16...cxd4 19.g4, a tactical mistake that significantly improved White's position. Alternatively, 15...Nd5 offered Black a better position.

In Sion Castro-Karpov, Black's early 12...g5! was crucial. White's 14.g4 was a mistake, allowing Black to counter with 14...Bb7, leading to a strong position for Black. The game demonstrated that Black's proactive approach with 12...g5 was the better choice."
"Up until now, the queen almost automatically retreated to e2, for example, Sokolov played this against me once (Belfort 1988). This game turned out in white's favor and is annotated by Beliavsky (Game 23). On 11.Qh4, theory indicates 11...Nd5, but after 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.c3,white has a small positional advantage, and more importantly, black has little play. After 11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 Qh5 13.Qxh5 Nxh5 14.Ne5! 0-0 15.0-0-0, black also does not have enough counterplay (Hector-Hodgson, London 1991): 15...c5 (better is 15...Nf6) 16.g4 Nf6 17.g5! hxg5 18.Bxg5 Nd5 (if 18...cxd4 19.Bxf6 gxf6 20.Rdg1+ Kh8 21.Rg3! Be5 22.Rh3+ and Rg1+) 19.Nc4 Bc7 20.dxc5, with a noticeable white advantage. Of course, 11...0-0 is bad because of the standard 12.Bxh6! gxh6 13.Qxh6, after which black will not survive; 14.Ng5 is enough of a threat.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the strategic disadvantages and potential threats of the move 11...Qa5+, referring to standard chess principles and illustrating the consequences of the move with concrete examples from past games.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5 Ngf6 6. Bd3 e6 7. N1f3 Bd6 8. Qe2 h6 9. Ne4 Nxe4 10. Qxe4 Nf6 11. Qh4,"This is a game between Kamsky, G (as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h4"," The move 11.Qh4 by White was considered suboptimal because it allowed Black to respond with 11...Qa5+, which threatens 12.Bd2 Qh5, putting White under pressure. Despite the possibility of White gaining a slight advantage after 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.c3, Black's position remains poorly developed with limited counterplay. Black can try to improve by playing 15...c5, which is better than 15...Nf6, but White can still maintain a lead with 16.g4 followed by 17.g5, putting further pressure on Black's position.

The move 11.Qh4 was a bad choice as it led to a difficult situation for White. After 11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 Qh5, White is put in a precarious position. Despite the potential for a small advantage after 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.c3, Black's position is still far from favorable, giving White little to play for. Even with"
"This quite paradoxical king move to the center of the board was found by me back in 1988, while I was preparing for the aforementioned game against Kasparov. I was afraid of the queen shift to the kingside. The exchange of queens seemed to me to be a dull idea. It took me a long time before I found the correct decision. And so this important novelty remained a secret for five years! The idea of the king move is that black unexpectedly harmonizes the placement of his pieces, which were a bit out of sync only a move ago. But now the threat is g7-g5-g4, winning a piece. If white wants to maintain the opening advantage, he must act decisively.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it provides insight into their thought process and how their fear of a queen shift led to the unexpected king move, which subsequently resulted in a strong threat for black.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

White needed to make a move that didn't let Black's pieces come together too well. Now Black has a strong plan to push their pawn to g4 and capture a White piece. White has to be quick to stop that.'
"The most ambitious decision. White sacrifices a pawn, noting that the enemy king is stranded in the center. Of course, 12.Bf4 Bb4+ 13.Bd2 (otherwise 13...g5) 13...Bxd2+ 14.Kxd2, hardly suits him.",True,"

"Also possible is 14.Bd2 Qxe5+ 15.Be3, and it is quite unsafe for black to grab the second pawn on b2. But the position of the white pawn on c3 is more convenient for him than on c2.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake by highlighting the potential danger of white's pawn structure after 14.Bd2 Qxe5+ 15.Be3, as it leaves the b2 pawn weak, but also points out that the c3 pawn position is preferable for white.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.
