"I have refraimed from commenting on the opening lest I infringe Colin McNab's copyright. Here he gives 18...h5, and the omission of that move proves highly significant.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as omitting the move 18...h5 is a significant error in the given chess position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5.

(as White) and Onoda, Hirokaz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f8"," In this game, Black plays Knight to f8, which is a critical misstep. This move fails to develop pieces effectively and neglects central control."
"He might as well, since after 26... Bc8 or 26... Re7 to defend f7, 27.bxc5 really would be strong.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the move 27. bxc5 exposes the c5 pawn to potential attack and neglects the defense of the f7 square.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. d4 c6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. e4 e5 9. h3 Qa5 10. Re1 exd4 11. Nxd4 Ne5 12. Bf1 Re8 13. Rb1 Be6 14. b4 Qc7 15. f4 Ned7 16.

Re7, which would effectively defend the f7 square."""
I hope you noticed the threat of mate in 2. BM For those of you who missed it the answers at the end of the game.,True,"

The comment implies that the previously played move by the player was a mistake due to the immediate threat of checkmate, which the player likely overlooked.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. d4 c6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. e4 e5 9. h3 Qa5 10. Re1 exd4 11. Nxd4 Ne5 12. Bf1 Re8 13. Rb1 Be6 14. b4 Qc7 15. f4 Ned7 16. Be3 a5 17. a3 axb4 18. axb4 Nf8 19. Bf2 Bd7 20. Qb3 Ne6 21.

No this was not a clerical error! White would also win quickly after,True,"

The comment explains the mistake well because it suggests that the move made by White may not have been a simple clerical error, but rather a strategic misstep that White could easily capitalize on for a quick win.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. d4 c6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. e4 e5 9. h3 Qa5 10. Re1 exd4 11. Nxd4 Ne5 12. Bf1 Re8 13. Rb1 Be6 14. b4 Qc7 15. f4 Ned7 16.

(as White) and Onoda, Hirokaz (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"," They made a poor move, Black, by playing Pawn to d5. It likely leads to an unfavorable position."
"Black finally resigned in view of 36...Qd2+ 37.Re2 Rxe2+ 38.Nxe2 Qxe2+ 39.Kh1. The Ng5 plays a crucial role in both attack and defence, despite having been en prise since move 28! BM The threat was smothered mate with 29.Qg8+ Nxg8 30.Nf7. You really have to keep an eye on these champions as they can come up with all sorts of nasty tricks!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, stating the critical role of the moves leading to the mate threat and highlighting the importance of vigilantly monitoring the opponent's threats.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. d4 c6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. e4 e5 9. h3 Qa5 10. Re1 exd4 11. Nxd4 Ne5 12. Bf1 Re8 13. Rb1 Be6 14. b4 Qc7 15. f4 Ned7 16.

Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on a2"," White played Bishop takes on a2, a move that leads to quick checkmate. Ng5, although a powerful piece, was misplayed by Black from the start and was vulnerable since move 28. After Black's move, White's queen to g8 and a subsequent knight move to f7 put Black in a dire situation, resulting in checkmate. It's crucial to closely monitor the players' strategies as they are capable of devising complex traps."
