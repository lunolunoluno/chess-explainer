 (Reformulation of a series of chess comments)
Here is the context:
                     'In this match, we have Fischer, Bobby (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black). The last moves were: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6.'
                     You don't have to mention anything about the context in the reformulated comment unless deemed necessary.
                     Here are the comments that you have to reformulate:
                     - 'White's knight on f3 is attacking Black's pawn on e5 and Black's knight on c6 is defending it.'
                     - 'Black's pawn on a6 is a strategic move to challenge White's bishop.'
                     - 'White's bishop on b5 is eyeing the knight on c6, which is a classical Ruy Lopez opening.'

Remember that you have to simplify the comments to only keep the explanation"

"After this it's clear Black's plan is to occupy square d5, trade off White's light square bishop, occupy the central files with rooks and pressure Pd4. White has used h2-h3 to prevent ...Bc8-g4xf3, but Pd4 will be a weakness for some time. White, on the other hand, has use of Pd4 and the control of e5 it provides. Black's most dangerous piece is the one which can attack Pd4, so Bc1-g5, aiming to trade for Be7, might be very good. Perhaps White should encourage Black to occupy d5 (a2-a3 Nb4-d5) with a minor piece, so the file won't be open and Pd4 might be more safe.
