Nc3 Nf6 4. f3,This is a game between Lehman (as White) and Smyslov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3," White's last move, the Pawn to f3, is a mistake.

The comment indicates the player attacked both the bishop and pawn, suggesting that the move was aggressive but potentially risky, which may explain the mistake if the opponent countered effectively.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3.

The comment explains the mistake because by not playing 39... Ke3, the opponent overlooked the winning tactic of capturing the rook on a7 with 39. Rxa7 followed by 40. Bc4, which would have led to a winning position.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 Nc6 5. fxe4 e5 6. dxe5 Nxe5 7. Nf3 Bd6 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 O-O 10. Nd5 Nxf3+ 11. gxf3 Be7 12. Nxe7+ Qxe7 13.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to a2," White resigned because Black had a strong attacking position after the move. The rook on a2 was trapped, and with moves like Bxa2, Black could easily win the rook on the next turn. After the rook's capture, Black's bishop on d5 would threaten the White king, which could lead to a check on the next move. Even if White tried to defend with moves like Ra1+ and Kd2, Black's next potential move, b6, would further secure the rook and ultimately lead to a checkmate."
