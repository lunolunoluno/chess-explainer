Qg5 Qe8,"This is a game between Bronstein, David (as White) and Korchnoi, Viktor (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e8"," White's last move, advancing their queen to e8, is a poor choice that weakens their position. By moving the queen to e8, White makes it vulnerable to attacks, especially from Black's pieces which can now target it more easily. This move also neglects the development of White's own pieces, which is crucial in the opening phase of the game. As a result, Black can seize the opportunity to initiate a strong counter-attack."
