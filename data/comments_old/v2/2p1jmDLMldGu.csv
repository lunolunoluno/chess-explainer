"E97: King's Indian: Classical Main Line (6...e5 7 0-0 Nc6): 8 Be3 and 8 d5 Ne7, not 9 Ne1",True,"
The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player in advancing the knight to e1 instead of developing the bishop to e3, which is a better preparation for the center and connects the rooks.",1. d4,"This is a game between Granda Zuniga, Julio E (as White) and Polgar, Ju (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," This move is not ideal, White, as it allows Black to gain control of the center and open up lines for further development. Instead, White should continue with Be3 to support the d5 push and maintain pressure."
Covers g5,False,"

The comment ""Covers g5"" does not explain the mistake made by the player as it seems to describe a strategic idea or a defensive move rather than an error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. dxe5 Ngxe5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Be3 Qf6 14.

Do you see the mate threat?,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it does not address why the move was an error or provide any insight into the incorrect decision.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6.

The mate threat is Rg3,True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake by highlighting the potential mate threat, which indicates that the previous move was not as strong as it should have been.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. dxe5 Ngxe5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Be3 Qf6 14. Rc1 Rae8 15. b3 h6 16. Qd2 g5 17. Nd4 Nxd4 18. Bxd4 g4 19.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to h3"," Granda Zuniga, as White, has played a move that allows Black, Ju, to potentially create a mate threat with Rg3."
Threatening mate: g3,False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as a move of ""g3"" is not a direct threat of mate and does not indicate a blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. dxe5 Ngxe5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Be3 Qf6 14. Rc1 Rae8 15. b3 h6 16. Qd2 g5 17. Nd4 Nxd4 18. Bxd4 g4 19. Kh1 Qg6 20. Rg1 Qh5 21. Nd5 Be4 22.

gives the opponent counterplay,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by suggesting that the move provided the opponent with an opportunity to attack or gain an advantage, which is a common outcome of poor play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. dxe5 Ngxe5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Be3 Qf6 14. Rc1 Rae8 15. b3 h6 16. Qd2 g5 17. Nd4 Nxd4 18. Bxd4 g4 19.

Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on f3"," 'White's move on f3 doesn't threaten anything, offering a free move for Black to take advantage.'"
Do you see the mate threat?,True,"
The comment ""Do you see the mate threat?"" implies that the move made by the player was a blunder that allowed a checkmate, which explains the mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. dxe5 Ngxe5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Be3 Qf6 14. Rc1 Rae8 15. b3 h6 16. Qd2 g5 17. Nd4 Nxd4 18. Bxd4 g4 19. Kh1 Qg6 20. Rg1 Qh5 21.

Last move played: Black plays King to h8", Is it clear why Black's move to h8 was not advantageous?
