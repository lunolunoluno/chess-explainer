"Going into this game Anand stands in last place by himself. This is uncharacteristic. Also, Kasparov has the lead by himself and this is characteristic. It's a slender lead of only one-half point over the next five (5!) tied players. A win by either player puts him into contention and severely hurts the other player's chances.",False,"

Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4",-
"It's curious Shirov would play this only a round after Ponomariov did the same versus Anand (result, a draw) .",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential risk of repeating the same move as Ponomariov against Anand, which resulted in a draw.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"," Shirov played e5, which is a similar move to what Ponomariov did, leading to a draw against Anand. This move choice could be seen as a risk for Black, as it doesn't create much space for their pieces and can be easily countered by White."
"But, Anand varies; not repeating 6. c4 from the earlier game. White threatens Nc3-d5, Nb5-c7+.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it identifies the variation from the previous game and highlights the threats created by White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. N1c3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"," ""White's choice of Knight to c3 is seen as a deviation from their standard approach, as they typically opt for 6. c4 in similar situations.

As in a Sveshnikov Black threatens ...b5-b4 and uses Pb5 to prevent Na3-c4-e3.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by explaining the potential threat posed by the Sveshnikov variation and how it involves using the pawn on b5 to prevent the central knight from gaining space, indicating a misunderstanding of the opening strategy.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. N1c3 a6 7. Na3 b5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"," White's move to Pawn to b5, while aiming to counter Black's threat on b4, overlooks the immediate need for piece development and King safety.

Simplified Explanation:
Black's strategy to play...b5 appears aggressive, targeting White's knight at c4. However, this move hinders White's development, especially the knight's ability to reposition to a more active square. Additionally, it may prematurely expose the king without adequate defenses, making it vulnerable to attacks."
"After this White might intend Bc1-e3-b6 followed by Nd5-c7+. But, Black won't leave Nd5 unchallenged.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a potential plan for White without addressing the immediate issue of Black's position or the specific move that was made incorrectly.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This is different from the c2-c4 he played against Ponomariov. In this situation the pawn is almost assured of being exchanged for Pb5. In any case it makes sense to support Nd5 and doing it with this threat to Pb5 is useful. Of course, he had to calculate the effects of 9...Nxe4 10. cxb5 Qa5+.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the ineffective c2-c4 pawn move and suggests a better decision to support the knight on d5, while also discussing the potential threat to the opponent's bishop.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"," 'The White player moves Pawn to c4, which is unlike their previous strategy against Ponomariov, where they aimed to exchange the pawn. This pawn move in the current game gives Black a strong option to attack the Knight on d5. Supporting the knight with this threat is not advisable, as it puts the White player's position at risk. The White player should have considered the consequences of Black's potential moves, like 9...Nxe4 and 10. cxb5 Qa5+, which could lead to a disadvantageous position.'"

"This creates an opportunity for White to show d5 isn't sufficiently guarded, or to be more precise that d5 and all of Black's queen-side is weak.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential weakness that was created in White's position, specifically pointing out the vulnerability of the d5 square and Black's queen-side.",1. e4 c5 2.

"After this Rc8 is defended, so that ... Nc6xb4 is a real threat. Any move such as ...Nc6-d8 also uncovers a strong threat to Pe4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move Rc8 was a mistake because it opened up a significant threat to the pawn on e4, and suggests alternative moves that could have led to a more favorable position for the opponent.",1. e4 c5 2.

"I suppose he had his choice of chasing Qg3 onto the c1-h6 diagonal, but Be3 seems better than Bf2. Also, by having Kd1 he avoids ...Nc6xb4-c2+.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the better move Be3, avoiding the potential threat of...Nc6xb4-c2+ against the king.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5.

"But, now Black's really in a pickle: Be3 and Rc8 are both attacked.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as both Be3 and Rc8 squares are indeed attacked by the opponent's pieces, putting Black's bishop and rook at risk.",1. e4 c5 2.

Is this the only way to hope to activate Bb7 and force line openings to get at Kc2?,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting that the player's move might not have been the most effective way to activate the bishop (Bb7) or open line openings against the king (Kc2).",1. e4 c5 2.
