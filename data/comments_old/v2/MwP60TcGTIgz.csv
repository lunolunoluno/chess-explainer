A88: Dutch Defence: Leningrad System: 5 Nf3 0-0 6 0-0 d6 7 Nc3 c6,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player, as it only provides information about a specific opening but doesn't address the quality of the move in question.",1. d4,"This is a game between Ibragimov, Ildar (as White) and Kramnik, Vladimir (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4",-
last book move,True,"

The comment ""last book move"" indicates that the move was not effective, as it was likely a well-known mistake that could be found in chess literature.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19. Rfe1 Bxg2,"This is a game between Ibragimov, Ildar (as White) and Kramnik, Vladimir (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on g2"," In the last move, White played Bishop to g2, which was poorly positioned and didn't contribute significantly to the game's strategy."
e7 seems the pivot of the position,True,"

Last move played: White plays Rook to e4"," Black's last move seems overly aggressive, potentially exposing them to counterplay."
The white bishop on an outpost,True,"

The comment ""The white bishop on an outpost"" implies that the bishop was positioned on a square from which it can control many opponent pieces, but it doesn't directly explain the mistake made by the player.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19.

A valuable piece,False,"

The comment ""A valuable piece"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not provide any information about the move's quality or consequences.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3.

Kg1 Nd5,"This is a game between Ibragimov, Ildar (as White) and Kramnik, Vladimir (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d5",-
Do you see the mate threat?,True,"

The comment indicates that the player has created a mate threat, implying they have made a move that could lead to checkmate on the next turn.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19. Rfe1 Bxg2 20. Kxg2 Qf5 21. Re4 Rbe8 22.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to f4"," ""Wasn't that an aggressive move for Black, potentially setting up a mate threat?"""
The mate threat is Rg4,True,"
The comment accurately points out the mistake by indicating that the move could be a direct mate threat with Rg4, which shows that the opponent is potentially facing a critical threat that they might have overlooked.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19.

keeping the advantage,True,"

The comment ""keeping the advantage"" suggests that the player made a move which unexpectedly maintained their upper hand in the game, but the fact that it was still mentioned as a mistake implies that it did not benefit them as much as it could have.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to g4 with check", 'They're risking the advantage by advancing their rook.'
Theme: Deflection from d3,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as deflection is when a piece moves away from its defending square, often to capture an attacking piece, which seems to be the issue in this scenario.",1. d4 d6 2. c4 f5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Qe8 8. b3 Na6 9. Ba3 c6 10. Qd3 Rb8 11. e4 fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Qd2 Nc7 15. Rae1 Qd7 16. h4 b5 17. Re3 bxc4 18. bxc4 Bh3 19.

Qd3 Qh3 36. Nf3 Nf4 37. gxf4 Rxf4 38. Ne5 Rg4+ 39. Nxg4,"This is a game between Ibragimov, Ildar (as White) and Kramnik, Vladimir (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on g4"," ""White's last move led them to deflect from a strong central position, losing potential control over the d3 square."""

Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on d4 with check"," 'White's bishop move to d4, while aggressive, poses a significant threat to Black's position, potentially leading to a compromised pawn structure and weakened king safety if not carefully countered.'"
