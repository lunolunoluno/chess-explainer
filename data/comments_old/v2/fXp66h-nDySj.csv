"(Tactics already, keep your eyes open at all times!)",True,"

This comment likely refers to the player missing a tactical opportunity, which implies a mistake was made.",1. b3 g6 2. Bb2 Nf6 3. e4 Bg7 4. Nf3 d6 5. Nc3,"This is a game between Kilgariff, Andrew (as White) and Lloyd, Geoff (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3", 'Consider the Knight's position; it's too early for tactics and better to develop pieces instead.'
(Well my pawns look pretty healthy to me and the centres on a plate.),False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it merely discusses the health of the pawns and control of the center, rather than addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. b3 g6 2.

"#(I have been pushing the f pawn with a great deal of success in OTB play in the Modern Defence, particularly when White responds to Qb6 with Qb3 and an early exchange of Queens follows. The f file is a dangerous file to occupy. just look at the centre now!)",False,"

The comment does not directly address the specific move made by the player but rather provides general advice on the Modern Defence and the danger of occupying the f file.",1. b3 g6 2.

(The moves play themselves.),False,"

The comment is dismissive and does not actually explain the specific mistake made by the player.",1. b3 g6 2. Bb2 Nf6 3. e4 Bg7 4. Nf3 d6 5. Nc3 Nxe4 6. Bc4 Nxc3 7. Bxc3 Bxc3 8. dxc3 O-O 9.
