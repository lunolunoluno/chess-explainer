"9...Qc7 is more common, but I wanted to go into turbulent, uncharted areas.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it acknowledges the commonality of the move while justifying the decision to deviate from that path for experimental purposes.",1. e4 c5 2.

Possible is 10...Qc7!? 11.a5 b5 12.axb6 Nxb6.,True,"

The comment explains that the mistake was made by playing 10...Bxd5, which allows the immediate recapture with 11.axb6, leading to a vulnerable position for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

"I considered 15...Rfd8, but if he plays his knight to d5 my play will be on the e-line.",True,"

17...Nc5? 18.Nxc5 dxc5 19.Bc4 is much better for White.,True,"

As the b-pawn isn't so tasty 18.Rcd1 was better.,True,"

The comment accurately explains that 18.Rcd1 was a better move because it protected the b-pawn and improved the position of the rook on the c-file.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

Better is 24.Rcd1 Bxd2 25.Qxd2 (25.Rxd2 Qa7!?) 25...Qc7 with level chances.,True,"

27.Bxa6? loses to 27...Rxc3.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by highlighting that the move ""27.Bxa6?"" allows the opponent to capture the pawn with ""27...Rxc3,"" resulting in a material loss for the player.",1. e4 c5 2.

White had 9 minutes left for 6 moves and solves my main problem: How to trade rooks! This is equally true if he had a bishop instead.,False,"
