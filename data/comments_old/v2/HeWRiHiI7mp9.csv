"Today playing 4.Bc1 before Ng1-f3 is considered an inaccuracy, because of 4... c5!",True,"
The comment accurately points out that the move 4.Bc1 is a mistake due to the potential response 4... c5.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"," ""This move, 4.Bc1, is suboptimal for White as it neglects the potential of 4... c5 by Black, which would challenge White's central control."""
"Even the great Lasker underestimated the danger of White's clamp on the queenside. Only 90 years later Black found the right way to create counterchances, in the game Lerner-Geller: 6...b6 7.b4...",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the significant oversight in not creating counterplay against White's strong position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. c5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c5"," Lasker, Black, underestimated White's threat, which eventually led to a successful counterchance by Black in the Lerner-Geller game."
Of course Lasker doesn't wait for the realisation of White's plan. But his attempt to organize counterplay in the centre plays directly into Steinitz' hand.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the player, presumably Lasker, made a mistake by not waiting for White's plan to materialize and subsequently organizing counterplay in the center, which benefited Steinitz.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. c5 Ne4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4"," This move by Black doesn't align with the plan White set up. By trying to counteract in the center, Lasker inadvertently aids Steinitz."
"preventing Nb4-d5, and also keeping the bishop on an important diagonal after Na5, Ba2.",True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates the loss of the bishop on a7, which could potentially be lost after Nb4-d5.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"," ""Preventing the Black knight from advancing to d5 and securing the White bishop's active position on an important diagonal."""
"A concrete decision: White's advance on the queenside will be met by e6-e5, which is why Steinitz changes direction, preparing an attack against the weakened black centre and potentially on the kingside.",False,"

The comment does not directly relate to the mistake made by the player, as it discusses a potential response (e6-e5) and a shift in strategy rather than focusing on the error in the move itself.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. c5 Ne4 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Qc2 f5 9. Bc4 Nc6 10. a3 Bf6 11. O-O-O,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black).

refusing the pawn sacrifice that would give Black an initiative:,True,"

Very typical for Lasker - by complicating dubious positions he won many great games. Now he hoped for 14.Bxf4... #,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, stating that Lasker's strategy of complicating dubious positions led to many great wins. The reference to ""14.Bxf4..."" suggests a specific move that was considered a complication in this particular game.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. c5 Ne4 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Qc2 f5 9. Bc4 Nc6 10. a3 Bf6 11. O-O-O Kh8 12. f3 Qe7 13. Bg3 f4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f4"," Lasker's strategy often involves engaging in complex situations to gain an advantage, which has resulted in victories in several notable games. With this move, Black is attempting to complicate play. However, this move, 14...Bxf4, is not advisable as it weakens Black's pawn structure and opens up vulnerabilities."
"White has gained only two pawns for the piece, but his initiative will encounter no more obstacles.",True,"

Giving up the third pawn Lasker hopes to use the g-file for defence. After the obvious,True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic blunder of sacrificing a pawn in an attempt to gain a long-term positional advantage, hoping to utilize the g-file for defense.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. c5 Ne4 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Qc2 f5 9. Bc4 Nc6 10. a3 Bf6 11. O-O-O Kh8 12. f3 Qe7 13. Bg3 f4 14. Qxe4 fxg3 15. hxg3 g6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W.
