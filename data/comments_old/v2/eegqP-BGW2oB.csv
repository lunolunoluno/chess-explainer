"""Lasker gave in one of his books (""Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood"", I believe) the order 1 d4 f5 2 Nf3 e6 3 Nc3, with a comment about White's third move not being good."" (Marshall Chess Club 23.01. 2001) Of course, if 3 Nc3 is not good after 1 d4 f5 2 Nf3 e6, then it will also not be good after 1 d4 e6 2 Nf3 f5. It is natural to want to believe Edward Lasker himself, but, unfortunately he gave different versions of the game in different places, so he must have goofed at least once, and possibly more than once. ""Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood"", was written decades after the game was played. The other occasion when Edward Lasker wrote about the game was six years after the event. Edward Winter found the 1 d4 e6 2 Nf3 f5 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Be7 5 Bxf6 Bxf6 6 e4 fxe4 7 Nxe4 b6 8 Ne5 0-0 9 Bd3 Bb7 version in Bachmann's Schachjahrbuch 1912. Richard Forster said that this version was also given in ""the column in De Amsterdammer, 17 November 1912, by Loman, who was a regular at the City of London Chess Club"".

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it references the historical variations of the game and highlights the confusion around the quality of the move 3 Nc3 in different versions, suggesting the player might have followed an incorrect understanding from Lasker's writings.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3,"This is a game between Lasker, Edward (as White) and Thomas, George (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"," Edward played 3. Nc3, but it's not considered good. 

Although Lasker (White) wrote different versions of the game in various books, it seems that he made a mistake. The game was detailed in a 1912 edition of Bachmann's Schachjahrbuch and also mentioned by Loman in the Amsterdammer. The move 3. Nc3 isn't strong, and this version shows that with the game continuing as they did."
"There is some dispute about the order of the first few moves of this game. Richard Foster thought that the best guess was 1 d4 e6 2 Nf3 f5 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Be7 5 Bxf6 Bxf6 6 e4 fxe4 7 Nxe4 b6 8 Ne5 0-0 9 Bd3 Bb7. More on this subject can be found in Edward Winter's book, Chess Explorations. (Louis Blair - RGCM 21/01/01 )",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it discusses the order of the moves and suggests a better sequence of moves, indicating that the original move played was not the best choice.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3.

Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b7"," The move played by Black involving the Bishop to b7 is considered suboptimal. Foster suggests that the sequence of moves might not accurately represent the best strategy, as it can be found detailed further in Edward Winter's work on Chess Explorations."

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses a winning strategy rather than addressing the error in the previous move.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 e6 5.

"""Jeremy Silman wrote in his CL column something about how he had often attempted to repeat that game but never managed it, the closest I came was in a net game where I got as far as 11 Qh7+ Kh7 12 Nf6+ but then the guy played ...Kh8. Pretty disappointing.""(Marshall Chess Club - 23.01.2001) I wonder if it is really a good idea to try to immitate this game. If I remember correctly, John Nunn did not think that White had a particularly good position after the natural move, 10... Bxe5. (Louis Blair - RGCM 24.01. 2001)",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it provides a direct analysis of the game, suggesting that White did not have a particularly good position after the move 10... Bxe5, which implies the move in question was not optimal.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 e6 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 Bxf6 7. Nf3 b6 8. Ne5 O-O 9. Bd3 Bb7 10. Qh5 Qe7 11. Qxh7+ Kxh7 12.

I wonder if it's a good idea to try to imitate this game. If it's remembered correctly, Black would have been in a better position after the natural move. (Louis Blair, RGCM 24.01.2001)"
"Funny! ""In the same mentioned above Edward Lasker gives the last move as Kd2 and not 0-0-0, which you also sometimes see. Tastes vary but I always preferred Kd2, since the rook mates from farther away."" (Marshall Chess Club - RGCM 23/01/01)",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it clarifies that the player should have moved the king to d2 instead of attempting to castle queenside (0-0-0), which was mentioned as a potential move that the player often considered but prefers Kd2 to keep the rook mated from a greater distance.",1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3.

Last move played: White plays King to d2 with check"," Lasker, Edward (White) played a move that many find unusual. Preferring to use Kd2 over castling long with 0-0-0, Lasker's choice seems to prioritize keeping the rook active from a distance. However, it's a move that might not align with everyone's taste."
