Just to let White understand that he can suddenly lose the first move advantage.,True,"

The comment accurately points out that White has made a move that could potentially lead to losing the advantage gained from the first move, indicating that the move was a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Bd3 Nc6,"This is a game between Grau, Roberto (as White) and Nimzowitsch, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"," ""White should be aware that they might lose their initial advantage."""
"According to Tartakower this move is a waste of time. Indeed, he says, the loss of the game is because of such a waste of time. Difficult to believe? Here one could play:",True,"

Bd3 Nc6 5. c3 Bd6 6. Nf3 Nge7 7. Qc2,"This is a game between Grau, Roberto (as White) and Nimzowitsch, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2"," According to Tartakower, the move made by White is considered inefficient. Tartakower suggests that such a move might not be the best strategy and could potentially lead to a loss of the game. Critics might find it hard to accept, but a different approach could be explored.

In this context, White has just played a Queen move to c2."

"Removes the lightsquared Bishop, but also weakens the castling. 11...",True,"

Bd3 Nc6 5. c3 Bd6 6. Nf3 Nge7 7. Qc2 Bg4 8. Nbd2 Qd7 9. O-O f6 10. Re1 g5 11. h3,"This is a game between Grau, Roberto (as White) and Nimzowitsch, A. (as Black).

The comment focuses on the symmetry of attacks and the importance of the time factor, but it does not directly address the specific mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Bd3 Nc6 5. c3 Bd6 6. Nf3 Nge7 7. Qc2 Bg4 8. Nbd2 Qd7 9. O-O f6 10. Re1 g5 11. h3 Be6 12. Nf1 O-O-O 13. b4 Rdg8 14. a4 Nd8 15. b5 h5 16.

Rxa3 h4,"This is a game between Grau, Roberto (as White) and Nimzowitsch, A. (as Black).
