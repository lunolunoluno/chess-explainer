"E97: King's Indian: Classical Main Line (6...e5 7 0-0 Nc6): 8 Be3 and 8 d5 Ne7, not 9 Ne1",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player by pointing out an inappropriate move (9 Ne1) in the King's Indian Defense Classical Main Line, suggesting a better move (8 Be3 and 8 d5 Ne7) instead.",1. d4,"This is a game between Khalifman, Alexander (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," Reformed Comment:

In the King's Indian Defense, White chose to retreat the knight to e1 instead of pushing d5, which is considered a less aggressive approach. This decision could lead to a slower development and less central control."
Consolidates f4,True,"

Threatening mate... how?,False,"

The comment doesn't properly explain the mistake made by the player; it expresses surprise at a potential threat but doesn't clarify why the move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4.

Threatening mate: Rxh2,True,"
