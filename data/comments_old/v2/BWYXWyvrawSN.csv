"# I think Tarrasch was quite happy with the opening results: White has a small but constant advantage, and there are chances to increase it without any risk. One would guess that Tarrasch expected something like 15...Nf8 and planned 16.Nd4 with growing pressure. Lasker knew that his best chance to avoid a long, maybe painful defence was to take Tarrasch out of his confident mood by doing something very provocative (on the chess board, of course!). And so he moves his rook contrary to all rules of conventional wisdom: Ich glaube, dass Tarrasch mit dem Ergebnis aus der Eroeffnung recht zufrieden gewesen ist: Weiss hat einen kleinen, aber anhaltenden Vorteil, und es gibt Moeglichkeiten, diesen Vorteil ohne Risiko zu vergroessern. Man kann vermuten, dass Tarrasch vielleicht einen Zug wie 15... Sf8 erwartete, wonach er 16.Sd4 mit wachsendem Druck geplant haben duerfte. Lasker wusste indes, dass der beste Weg, eine lange, qualvolle Verteidigung zu vermeiden, darin bestand, den Gegner aus seiner zufriedenen Stimmung herauszureissen. Das tat er mit einem provokativen Zug (auf dem Brett natuerlich!), der wider jede schachliche Vernunft zu gehen schien:",True,"

Black, keen on avoiding a drawn-out defense, likely expected the typical response of...Nf8, but White planned to escalate the tension with 16.Nd4 instead. This move could have been seen as provocative, aiming to disrupt White's comfort. In chess, such provocations can lead to unexpected shifts in the game's dynamics.'"
"From a pure chess point of view this idea is quite suspicious. The misplaced rook could cause Black considerable problems. But the goal was to make Tarrasch lose his composure in face of the impudent rook.
