C80: Open Ruy Lopez: Sidelines and 9 Nbd2,True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake, referencing both the opening and the move that led to the mistake.",1. e4,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," 'In the Ruy Lopez, White's 9 Nbd2 move is not optimal as it fails to address the Black's active position and potential threats, leading to a suboptimal set of sidelines.'"
weakening the position,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake as the player weakened their position by making an unwise move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Qg4+ Kf7,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f7"," 'Moving the king to f7 weakens Black's position, as it may expose the king to potential threats without sufficient protection.'"
Theme: Clearance for f5-c5,False,"

The comment does not directly address the quality of the move; it describes a potential future strategy instead of evaluating the mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Qg4+ Kf7 15. Qf5+ Ke7 16. e6,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e6",-
A pinning theme,True,"
The comment ""A pinning theme"" indicates that the player failed to properly utilize the strategy of pinning, leading to a loss of important tactical advantage or control.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Qg4+ Kf7 15. Qf5+ Ke7 16. e6 Bxe6,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on e6", White's bishop pin on e6 may have been an overly aggressive attempt to disrupt Black's coordination.
Clearance to allow e1-e5,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it identifies a lack of space or an opportunity (clearance) for an important pawn advance (e1-e5), which is a common tactical or strategic error in chess.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Qg4+ Kf7 15. Qf5+ Ke7 16. e6 Bxe6 17. Re1 Qd6 18. Bxe6 Nxe6 19. Ne4 Qe5 20. Bg5+ Kd7 21. Nc5+,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c5 with check"," Black is in a precarious position after White's move to c5, which delivers a check. Their king's safety is compromised, and immediate defense becomes necessary."
the final blow,False,"

The comment ""the final blow"" does not provide a clear explanation for the mistake made by the player, as it seems to imply a successful move instead of clarifying why the previous move was a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Qg4+ Kf7 15. Qf5+ Ke7 16. e6 Bxe6 17. Re1 Qd6 18. Bxe6 Nxe6 19. Ne4 Qe5 20. Bg5+ Kd7 21. Nc5+ Bxc5 22. Qf7+ Kd6 23. Be7+,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Mamedyarov, S. (as Black).
