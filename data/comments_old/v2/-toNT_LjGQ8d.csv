"Logical play, for oly in the end-game can White turn his extra pawn on the King side to account.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it seems to justify the move rather than critique it.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4",-
"Accepting the challenge of ""having it out in the centre"".",True,"

The comment implies that the player intentionally made a move to challenge the opponent's position in the center, which may indicate a mistake if it compromised their own position or was not supported by their overall strategy.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d4"," After Black's pawn captures on d4, White accepts the central challenge, aiming to gain control of the board's middle. This move is critical, as dominating the center often leads to a strategic advantage."
"Instead of this simple development, a more astute mobilisation result from 9. b3. 9...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests a better alternative move (9. b3) which would have been more strategic in terms of piece development.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"," Black's last move was not as strategically sound as their alternative. Instead of moving their Knight to c3, Black could have opted for the more promising 9...b3."
"After his rapid and straighforward development, Black has already overcome all the difficulties of the opening.",True,"

The comment clearly indicates that the player's move was a mistake, as it suggests that Black has already overcome the opening challenges, which implies that the move wasn't part of the plan to handle the opening.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3 O-O-O,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black).

Thus White's majority in the centre is held for a long time to come. 12...,False,"

The comment does not explain a mistake made by the player but instead suggests a strategic advantage for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8.

"With the idea of controlling his ""d2"", but all yhis regrouping behind the front demonstrates that all is not well with White. 16...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the flawed strategy of controlling the ""d2"" square without proper support or compensation, showing that the player's position is weak.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3 O-O-O 10. Bf4 Bc6 11. O-O Nf6 12. f3 Be7 13. Ng3 g6 14. Rfe1 Nd7 15. Nd1 Nb6 16. Nf1,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f1"," Black's move 16... shows some strategic weaknesses. White's attempt to control the ""d2"" square is clear, but Black's regrouping indicates potential issues in their position."
"Black has mass ed his troops on the critical sector and, in the sequel, will demonstrate that, in spite of the exchange of Queens, the end-game is not yet, and the play shows the sacrifices and other conceptions germane to the middle game.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by pointing out that Black's decision to mass troops in a critical sector is likely to lead to a complex end-game, emphasizing the strategic depth rather than a blatant error.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3 O-O-O 10. Bf4 Bc6 11. O-O Nf6 12. f3 Be7 13. Ng3 g6 14. Rfe1 Nd7 15. Nd1 Nb6 16. Nf1 Rd7 17. Be3 Rhd8,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to d8"," White's decision to move their Rook to d8 isn't strategically sound. This positioning doesn't contribute to the protection of Black's critical sector. The move suggests that White might have overlooked the importance of maintaining a solid defensive structure, especially since the Queens have already been exchanged. It's evident that in this encounter, White is not fully utilizing their pieces, which is a fundamental middle game principle."

The comment ""!"" indicates that the move made by the player was a blunder, as it is a standard notation for indicating a significant mistake in chess commentary.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

"Making for ""d5"".",True,"

The comment suggests that the player's move to ""d5"" was a strategic error, aiming to push forward and possibly create weaknesses in their own position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3 O-O-O 10. Bf4 Bc6 11. O-O Nf6 12. f3 Be7 13. Ng3 g6 14. Rfe1 Nd7 15. Nd1 Nb6 16. Nf1 Rd7 17. Be3 Rhd8 18. b3 c4 19.

"! - A magnificent conception, breaking down the King's defences.",False,"

"! - This resplendent pawn blockades, on its own, not only the adverse Knight but the whole trio of white pawns on the King side.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the mistake made by the player, as it discusses the blocking effect of a pawn rather than the reason the move was a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 c5 8. Ne2 Bd7 9. Nbc3 O-O-O 10. Bf4 Bc6 11. O-O Nf6 12. f3 Be7 13. Ng3 g6 14. Rfe1 Nd7 15. Nd1 Nb6 16. Nf1 Rd7 17. Be3 Rhd8 18. b3 c4 19.
