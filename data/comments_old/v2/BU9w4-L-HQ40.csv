"By playing 4...Nf6, Wollner avoids some of the terrifying tactics of the Danish proper. At the time, this was considered a fully viable mode of defense. Wollner, perhaps understandably, was reluctant to grab that final pawn. Today, theory claims that Black can wend his way to equality by giving back the material in a tactical counter-trick, as follows: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5 The first pawn is given back. 6.Bxd5 Nf6 7.Bxf7+ And now, the second. But hasn't Black gone too far -- isn't he dropping his Queen here? 7...Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ The counter-trap: Black regains his material. 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2. ""Theory"" judges this position to be equal. That may be true, but it's worth pointing out that the position is also very sharp, with substantial pawn majorities for each side. Some correspondence players have recently resurrected this variation as a winning attempt for White. It demands accurate defensive play from Black, because White's pawns advancing on the Kingside ""bite"" faster, thanks to Black's exposed Knight and King. In this side line, there's one other move also worth considering. When Black plays ... Nf6, White need not liquidate but can instead play for central domination by accenting his development: 7.Nc3 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 One of the many interesting points in this line is that Black cannot force an exchange of Queens here, thanks to a very clever tactical shot: 8...c6 ... apparently forcing the Knight to move, but -- 9.Nf6+ White pulls Black's pieces forcibly into a fork! 9...gxf6 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxf6+ ... and when the dust clears, White is the exchange ahead. That is the tactical rationale behind White's interesting winning attempt with Nc3. I have much more analysis of this in my secret notebooks!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by Wollner regarding the loss of the Queen after the move 7...Kxf7 because it highlights the tactical trap he fell into and the potential consequences of his decision.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6," Black's last move, Knight to f6, is considered a safer choice against White's aggressive Danish opening. However, White has a surprising tactical opportunity with Nc3 that could lead to a better position. Instead of exchanging queens immediately, Black should focus on accurate defense. If White plays Nc3, Black has to be wary of White's tactical shot Nf6+, which forces the knight to move and opens up a fork. Black's mistake would be to play c6, allowing White's queen to capture on d8, gaining an exchange. After the fork, White will have a decisive advantage. It's crucial for Black to navigate carefully in this sharp position."
"Charousek offers Black one more chance to take a pawn, any pawn!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting that Charousek's move offered Black a significant material advantage in the form of a pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3," White offers Black the opportunity to capture a pawn, but it's a risky move."
"Wollner is admirably ""modern"" in his lack of greed, and insists on completing his development.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only praises the player's development strategy without addressing the specific move that was played.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5,-
"Charousek follows suit, and the next few moves for each side are rather natural.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player. It merely describes the natural flow of the game following the move.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on c3,-
"But now something curious happens -- Charousek's imagination goes into overdrive! The most natural move here would be the simple and obvious Bg5, pinning the Knight and threatening Nd5 to disrupt the Kingside pawn formation. Black, however, could meet the pin with Nbd7, since he has not committed his N/b8 to c6 yet. Charousek therefore tries something which might, in the final analysis, be labeled a ""coffeehouse"" move. But if so, then coffeehouse chess is superb!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the move as a creative but unnecessary choice, potentially avoiding a more straightforward attack on Black's position.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle," Black's last move was the kingside castle. Charousek, as White, considers an aggressive Bg5 move, pinning the Knight and targeting Nd5 to disrupt Black's pawn structure on the kingside. However, Black might not be as vulnerable as it seems. They could counter with Nbd7, since Black has not yet committed their Knight to c6. Instead, Charousek opts for a less direct approach. This choice might be seen as a ""coffeehouse"" move, which ultimately could benefit Black."
"Well, what can the point of all of this be? The Knight is just hanging out there. We know that Nxf7 is, on general principles, a poor move -- trading two active minor pieces for a R + P is a bad deal in the opening and middlegame. Impatiently, Wollner tries to brush the Knight aside like Goliath trying to brush that pesky shepherd lad out of the way...",True,"

The comment accurately describes the error in the move, highlighting the poor strategic decision to trade two active minor pieces for a rook and pawn, which is generally disadvantageous in the opening and middlegame.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ng5,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g5," ""The move played by White with the Knight to g5 isn't considered strong because it exchanges two pieces with just a pawn and rook, which usually isn't a favorable trade in the opening phase. Black, being impatient, attempts to disregard the Knight as if it's inconsequential."""
"I hope some one later gave Wollner financial compensation for playing this move, because we are all in his debt!",False,"

The comment seems to be sarcastic and does not directly explain the mistake made by the player in their move.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O 8.

"Rules are made to be broken -- not often, but on just those occasions when genius rises to the occasion! Charousek has no intention of giving up his perfectly good Bishop for the Rook on f7. Instead, he has spied a fascinating feature of the position. We saw that by delaying the development of his Queen's Knight, Black has reserved the possibility of Nbd7 defending f6. But Charousek has seen -- and brilliantly exposes -- the dark side of Black's delayed development. The following combination is made possible because Black's Queen is undefended!",True,"

The comment provides a detailed explanation of the move's strategic implications and suggests that the player overlooked the potential danger of a future combination due to Black's delayed development.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ng5 h6 9. Nxf7,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f7," ""White's recent move, the Knight to f7, was a tactical error. It neglects the threat of a potential counterplay involving the Queen's Knight. By not developing that piece promptly, Black has an opportunity to play Nbd7 and protect the f6 pawn. White's delay has created a weakness that Black can exploit."""
This pulls the Rook away from the eighth rank. Now the d-pawn is pinned against the undefended Queen. Hence:,True,"

The comment accurately describes the consequences of the player's move, highlighting the strategic disadvantage of moving the rook away from the eighth rank and exposing the d-pawn to a potential pin against the undefended queen.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on f7, The move by Black weakens the d-pawn's defense and makes it vulnerable due to the queen's exposure.
"Only this move is a just followup to the Knight sacrifice. Black's N/f6 must move (or he has lost material for nothing), and White will push this pawn up to e6.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, pointing out that Black's Ng6 must move or lose material, and White will capture this pawn with e6.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ng5 h6 9. Nxf7 Rxf7 10. e5,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5, This move by White is a poor follow-up after the Knight sacrifice. Black must move their knight or fianchettoed bishop (N/f6) as delaying results in material loss. White's pawn to e6 is a bad decision.
"Now the point of the sacrifice is becoming clearer. Charousek is not simply attacking the Rook: he has also used the P/e6 to cut off the defense of Black's Knight on the light diagonal from c8 to g4. In a sense, this is a very sophisticated double attack. Wollner is no fool: he realizes his position is desperate. So he immediately plays for the counterattack.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the complexity and intention behind Charousek's sacrifice.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. Nxc3 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ng5 h6 9. Nxf7 Rxf7 10. e5 Ng4 11. e6,This is a game between Charousek (as White) and Wolner (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e6," Charousek executed a sophisticated double attack, not just aiming at the Rook but also severing the defense lines for Black's Knight on the light diagonal. Recognizing Black's precarious position, Charousek anticipated Black's counterattack."
"No points for subtlety, but full marks for bravery.",True,"

The comment acknowledges that the move was a mistake, as it lacks subtlety, but it also recognizes the player's courage in making an unconventional or risky move.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to h4," Black's last move of placing their queen on h4 was quite a bold play, but it lacked subtlety."
Charousek doesn't need to be asked twice.,True,"

The comment suggests that the player has made a repeatable mistake, which indicates the move was a blunder rather than a strategic decision.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bc5 6.

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on f7 with check, The last move by White was poor.
"But now, how to meet the threats at h2 and f2?",True,"

The comment directly addresses the player's mistake by highlighting the immediate threats on the board, suggesting that failing to respond to h2 and f2 can lead to a loss of material or a checkmate.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the missed opportunity to sacrifice on h3, allowing Black to gain a strong attacking position and threatening an additional sacrifice.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4," Charousek's last move seems like a blunder. Instead of capturing on f4, they could have played h3, putting pressure on the White bishop. Now, Black has a strong attack with the opportunity to sacrifice on h3, which also threatens the White pawn on d1."
"By threatening mate at e8, Charousek ensures that his B/f4 cannot be taken.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic error made by the player; Charousek made an aggressive move that led to a forced mate, leaving the opponent's bishop on f4 under threat.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Wollner realizes that he is now on the defensive, and he tries hard to cover the weak e8 square. But Charousek is not to be denied!",True,"

"Wollner finally develops his Knight, lending his Rook's defensive aid to the beleaguered e8 square. But Charousek has realized something tremendous about this position. His Rook, sitting at f1, is on the same file as the enemy King. ""Yes,"" you say, ""but what of it? I often get my Rook on the same file as the enemy King -- but my own pawn blocks the file, so what's the use?"" Youth and genius do not lose heart for such trifles. Charousek now sacrifices, not one, but two Queens to achieve the ultimate opening of all remaining lines!",True,"
The comment correctly identifies the strategic implications of placing a Rook on the same file as the enemy King and suggests that sacrificing Queens might open lines for a stronger attack.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"One of the finest sacrificial conclusions on record. Not often does one get to sacrifice two Queens to force checkmate before move 20! Talk about efficient piece deployment!!
