"My own opinion, not theory's!",False,"

"Planning to pressurise the pawn on e5, hoping that White will feel oblidged to open the kingside up with f4 & untimately g3.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of pressuring the pawn on e5 and the potential response of White, leading to an overextended kingside pawn structure.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to c5"," Bird (White) may consider pushing the e5 pawn to apply pressure, but Black has a countermove. By playing Qd5, Black challenges White's e5 pawn, forcing White to react defensively. This move doesn't directly attack White's position, but it puts White in a defensive posture, potentially disrupting White's plans to initiate an opening strategy like f4 followed by g3 on the kingside."
29.Bxb5 was much better.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because 29.Bxb5 would have been a better move, capturing a pawn and gaining material advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7.

Last move played: White plays Bishop to f1"," Bird played 29. Bxb5, which wasn't a great move."
Otherwise I was threatening the Rook fork from d2.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as they were missing an opportunity to create a Rook fork from d2, which could have led to a significant advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Last move played: White plays King takes on f3"," Bird, playing as White, made a move that was not in line with their strategy, as they were aiming to threaten the Rook fork from d2. Instead, they opted for a less effective play by taking the King on f3."
Apparent safety for the White King.,True,"

The comment suggests that the player's move has put the White King in a vulnerable position, which likely led to a loss of material or a strategic disadvantage, indicating a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Kh3,"This is a game between Bird, Graham (as White) and Cumming, David R (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to h3"," The move was not strategically sound, risking the White King's safety unnecessarily."
Because White was now threatening 35.Qb3.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates that White posed a threat with the move 35.Qb3, which the player likely failed to address or respond to appropriately.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Kh3 Kf7,"This is a game between Bird, Graham (as White) and Cumming, David R (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f7", The move 35.Qb3 by White was disadvantageous because it left Black's King on a vulnerable f7 square without sufficient protection.
"Instead of defending my queenside pawns, I decided to create mating threats to White's ""safe"" King.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as focusing on creating mating threats instead of prioritizing the defense of their own queenside pawns can lead to a compromised position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

"Otherwise 4 0...Rxh2 is +mate! But now if I play 40...Rxh2, White plays 41.Kg5 and the position now looks extremely promising for White, so...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move 0...Rxh2 leads to a checkmate threat but also highlights the counterattacking potential for White, which ultimately outweighs the immediate checkmate threat.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Last move played: White plays King to h4"," ""Playing 40...Rxh2 was a mistake. White has a strong continuation with 41.Kg5 that greatly improves their position."""
Blocking the White Queen's attack on the g6 pawn.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it does not clarify why blocking the White Queen's attack on the g6 pawn was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

45.gxh4?? Rcg2 and very soon White gets mated!,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake, as taking the rook with gxh4 allows Black to capture White's rook on g2, quickly leading to White's defeat.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. Be3 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bd3 cxd4 13. cxd4 Be6 14. Qa4 a6 15. Nf4 b5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Qa3 Bxd4 18. Bxd4 Qxd4+ 19.

Qe1+ Kf7,"This is a game between Bird, Graham (as White) and Cumming, David R (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f7"," Black has delivered mate in three moves. White is unable to prevent both the rook sacrifice (Rh8+) and the pawn promotion to a rook (h1=R+). If White tries to stop one, the other will still result in mate. For example, after 61.Qa1, Black responds with 61...Rxg3, then 62.Kh4, and finally 63.Kh5, with Black having a choice among Rh3+, Rdg8, or Rh8+ to deliver mate.

Alternatively, White could play 61.Qe6, but this merely extends the game by one move, with mate still arriving on the subsequent move. Therefore, Graham resigns, as there's no realistic way to defend against the imminent mate."
