"This seemed a good idea at the time, aiming to immobolise White's pawn centre. White's alternative of 6.exd6 en passaunt has the same effect.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out that the move under consideration has the same effect as a commonly known alternative, suggesting the move was not a good idea.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"," The move by Black to d5, aiming to immobilize White's pawn structure, turns out to be a drawback as White's response of exd5 achieves the same effect without the need for a pawn sacrifice."
This move looks illogical. With hind sight why not leave the King behind a blocked pawn centre?,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a common strategic error, as leaving a king behind a pawn center can lead to vulnerabilities and hinder mobility.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle", 'This kingside castle seems unwise. It's puzzling why Black didn't maintain a more solid pawn structure.'
Aiming to either destroy Whites pawn centre if he opts for 9.dxc5 Bxe5 or immobolise it completely by playing c4 next. But...,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by suggesting two potential weaknesses in their position and the possible continuation to exploit them.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"," After White's last move, Black's decision to play Pawn to c5 opens several strategic options. Black may aim to undermine White's strong pawn center by capturing on c5, which could be achieved with 9.dxc5 Bxe5. Alternatively, Black could choose to solidify its position by advancing c4, preventing White from establishing a strong center."
Never saw it coming (not quite the words used at the time). Now it is going to be a struggle just to survive.,True,"

The comment suggests that the player's move was unexpected and led to a disadvantageous position, indicating that it was a mistake.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5 9. Nxh7,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on h7", De Silva's (White) recent knight capture on h7 was unexpected. It's going to be challenging for them to maintain their position.
Looks no better a position than playing,True,"

The comment suggests that the move made by the player did not improve the position, implying that it was a mistake.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5 9. Nxh7 Kxh7,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King takes on h7", The position is disadvantageous for Black.
A desperate attempt to create space. I need to be able to move around the blocked centre if I am to defend against White's kingside pawns.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates a strategic misstep in aiming to create space while potentially neglecting the immediate need to address threats from the opponent's pawns.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5 9. Nxh7 Kxh7 10. Qh5+ Kg8 11. Qh4 c4 12. Be2 f5,"This is a game between de Silva, P A P. (as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"," Black's last move to f5 is an attempt to gain space in the center, which is crucial for their defense against White's kingside pawns."
"At last, a gap to work through.",True,"

The comment suggests that the player made a mistake that left an opportunity for the opponent, which they might find exploitable.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7.

(as White) and Savage, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6", 'Black's last move creates weaknesses.'
"White has regained the sacrificed piece, but can he capitalise on his passed pawn?",True,"
White made a mistake in not being able to capitalize on the passed pawn, which could have led to a better position or even a win as the move suggested a potential advantage.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5 9. Nxh7 Kxh7 10. Qh5+ Kg8 11. Qh4 c4 12. Be2 f5 13. Bg5 Nc6 14. f4 Kf7 15. g4 Rh8 16. Qg3 Bh6 17. h4 Bxg5 18. fxg5 e6 19. h5 Ne7 20.

Last move played: White plays Rook takes on d7"," Black's last move was poor, as they lost a piece and now have a weakness."
"And White has missed the chance to play gxf5. Now the locked pawns reduce the mobility of the White Queen, and help me hang on.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player who missed the opportunity to capture the pawn on f5, limiting the mobility of their own queen.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ng5 c5 9. Nxh7 Kxh7 10. Qh5+ Kg8 11. Qh4 c4 12. Be2 f5 13. Bg5 Nc6 14. f4 Kf7 15. g4 Rh8 16. Qg3 Bh6 17. h4 Bxg5 18. fxg5 e6 19. h5 Ne7 20.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f4"," White missed the opportunity to play gxf5, which would have restricted the movement of the White Queen further. This move could have increased White's control over the center and potentially put pressure on Black's position."
"# The barrier is complete. With the Knight on g6 covering the pawn on f4 and Rook on h8, with the King on b7 or c7, the Bishop on c6 covering Bxd5 and the Rook free to move to d8 to stop Qd6+, White has no way through without sacrifising a piece. The only remaining problem is to convince White he can't win.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, highlighting the lack of escape routes for White and the necessity to convince them they cannot win.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3.

With the Knight on g6 protecting the pawn on f4, and the Rook on h8, along with the King on either b7 or c7, and the Bishop on c6 controlling Bxd5. Additionally, the Rook can move to d8 to prevent Qd6+. White lacks a clear path to break through without giving up a piece. The primary issue is persuading White that they cannot secure a win.'"
Nxf3 is fatal as it frees g5.,True,"
The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake as Nxf3 would indeed allow the opponent to have a strong attack via g5, potentially gaining material or positional advantage.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3.

A sense of both relief and achievement!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it expresses positive emotions rather than providing an analysis of the error.",1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. Nc3 Nxc3 4. bxc3 g6 5. d4 d5 6.
