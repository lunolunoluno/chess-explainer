"E97: King's Indian: Classical Main Line (6...e5 7 0-0 Nc6): 8 Be3 and 8 d5 Ne7, not 9 Ne1",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that the knight should have stayed on e7 instead of moving to e1 after black's d5 move.",1. Nf3,"This is a game between Kramnik, V. (as White) and Polgar, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"," Black's recent move of 8...Ne7 is considered suboptimal in the Classical Main Line of the King's Indian Defense. The move Nc6, played earlier, prepares to fianchetto the bishop to e7, which is a common and strong setup for Black. Moving the knight to e7 does not contribute to the consolidation of Black's position nor does it support the central pawns. A stronger move would be 8...d5, challenging White's central pawn structure and gaining space in the center, which is more consistent with the ideas of the King's Indian Defense."

Black wins space,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because losing space does not necessarily mean the player made a wrong move; it could be a strategic choice.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

The bishop aims for Bf7-h5-f3-e4,False,"

A sound move,False,"

The comment ""A sound move"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it implies the move was good or strong, which contradicts the notion of a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Controls h4,True,"

The comment ""controls h4"" does explain the mistake made by the player if they were to move a piece that does not protect or control the h4 square, potentially leading to a weakening of their position.",1.

Threatening mate... how?,True,"

The comment suggests that the move made by the player was a blunder as it created an immediate threat of checkmate that was easily avoidable, indicating a lack of foresight or understanding of the board's dynamics.",1.
