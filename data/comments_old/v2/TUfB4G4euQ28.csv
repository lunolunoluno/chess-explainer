Straight out of the opening the game is heading into an endgame. A fashionable variation of the four knights symmetrical english is been played.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it indicates that the game has prematurely transitioned into an endgame, suggesting that the player has missed the opportunity to develop their pieces effectively and create a strong middle-game position, which is not typical for the opening phase.",1. c4 c5 2.

However, this choice is considered a poor decision as it deviates from the typical strategies of the four knights symmetrical English opening.'"
The first original move played in this game. Very typical for modern correspondence play: everybody has a big collection of games and it is nothing unusual to replay known games till late in the endgame.,False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it merely describes a common scenario in correspondence chess where players often choose to replay known games.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3.

"The plan looks like follows: White sequres his weak e2-pawn, then moves the king on the queen side where he is sure from enemy atacks. Next thing rooks are being doubled on the c-line and the pawns on the king side are being pushed in order to restrain the mobility of the black pieces. All of this time black is forced to think about defending the c-pawn and has little or no counterchances. I do not know if this variation is to be improved for black but I pretty sure would not like to try it.",True,"
The comment accurately identifies the strategic weaknesses in the player's plan, including the vulnerability of the e2-pawn, the limited king mobility, and the restricting pawn moves on the king side.",1. c4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"," After White's move Pawn to a3, Black should be focusing on consolidating their position. White's plan appears to involve strengthening their e2-pawn, moving the king to the queen's side, doubling rooks on the c-file, and advancing pawns on the king's side to limit Black's piece activity. However, this strategy puts Black at a disadvantage, as they are essentially forced to prioritize defending the c-pawn, which leaves them with limited options for counterplay. While it's uncertain if Black can improve their position, opting for this setup seems unwise."
to defend the e2-pawn,True,"

The comment ""to defend the e2-pawn"" adequately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the primary purpose of the move, which was to protect the pawn on e2.",1. c4 c5 2.

"Now the plan starts looking more clear: white will try to push his e-pawn till e5, then establish the knight on that square from where he threatens pawns on both sides. Of course I did not see the complete way to victory but I liked the idea of having a strong point at d6.",True,"

Last move played: White plays Knight to c4"," White's strategy of advancing their e-pawn to e5 and then positioning the knight to threaten pawns on both sides seems flawed. It's not immediately clear how this leads to a winning plan. The move may be part of a broader strategy, but it needs more development to showcase a clear path to victory."
Now for the rest of the white plan: another important goal is to exchange a pair of rooks (but only one since a knight endgame gives black additional changes). This means one of the white rooks has to be moved to the d-line when possible. Here a few variants:,False,"

"Now, why is this position won for white? The answer is that the two pairs of pawns at the sides of the board are much stronger than the connected central pawns of black.
