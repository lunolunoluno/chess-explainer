"As I was finishing this book I took part in one of the regular all-Master training tournaments held monthly in the San Francisco area. I found myself paired with a very strong opponent, Mike Arne (2400 FIDE). Since we were due to meet a few weeks later in an IM norm tournament, I decided that I shouldn't play my special preparation for him. Naturally with so much Spielmann on my mind I turned to one of his favorite lines, the Worral Attack in the Spanish Game. My preparation consisted solely of annotating a few games for this book, and the choice was made at the board. So this game shows that it is not necessary to study a lot of opening theory as White in the Spanish Game. All that is needed is some basic concepts, and either courage or recklessness!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it only reflects the player's personal feelings towards the game's pace rather than the strategic or tactical aspect of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

"This is probably not necessary, as Black's bishop is headed to b7, but I wanted to make sure it was kept off of g4, where the pin on the knight would weaken my control of d4.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by stressing the importance of keeping the bishop off of a critical square where it could create a weakness in the position.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"," Eric (White) played Pawn to h3. This move is unnecessary as it doesn't address any immediate threats or strategic objectives. It just opens up h3 without a clear purpose, leaving Black's bishop on b7 unimpeded."
I believe this was a novelty.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move was intended to surprise their opponent rather than being a clear error.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

"?! In retrospect, this is an error. The simple 12...Qe7 would have given Black an equal game.",True,"

This comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move in question was not optimal and that an alternative move (12...Qe7) would have led to a more balanced position for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

!? This is a deliberate sacrifice. I saw the Black forces huddled on the queenside and felt that a pawn could safely be invested for good attacking chances.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it supports the decision to sacrifice the pawn rather than stating the error in the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5.

"The idea is that if White captures the knight the pin the d4 allows captures at e5 with counterplay. Instead, I sacrifice a bishop and a rook to go after the undefended Black king.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the unconventional and unsound strategy of sacrificing major pieces to target the opponent's king prematurely, instead of pursuing a more solid and strategic plan.",1. e4 e5 2.

The comment ""!!"" does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it is a common notation in chess to indicate a blunder, but it does not specify the nature of the mistake.",1. e4 e5 2.

Now there is a long series of forced moves.,True,"

The comment implies that the mistake made by the player led to a sequence of moves that the opponent could force, suggesting that the player's move was not optimal and could have been avoided.",1. e4 e5 2.

Refactored Comment:

'White must proceed with forced moves, lacking strategic choices.'"
"If the Black king is allowed to capture the d-pawn, then the next time it moves it will expose the White king to check from the bishop at a7, and that may, in some circumstances, give Black enough time to regroup.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential threat to the White king and the opportunity for Black to gain advantage, showing a clear understanding of the consequences of the move.",1. e4 e5 2.

!! A quiet king move ends the spectacular combination. %30^000,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it acknowledges the player's quiet king move that failed to prevent the combination, and provides a score indicating the level of inaccuracy.",1. e4 e5 2.
