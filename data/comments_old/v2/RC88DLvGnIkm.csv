C87: Closed Ruy Lopez: Steinitz-type lines after 6 Re1 d6,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that the move (6 Re1) in the Closed Ruy Lopez opening does not correspond to the expected Steinitz-type lines.",1. e4,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Anastasian, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," The move played by White, moving the pawn to e4, leads to Closed Ruy Lopez, which often results in Steinitz-type lines after 6 Re1 d6. This can limit the activity of White's pieces and lead to passive positions."
