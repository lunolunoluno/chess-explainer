"! - Looks risky, since the Re1 and Bg5 are looking at the Qe7 straight into the eyes.",True,"

The comment rightly points out a strategic error, where the move Bg5 exposes the queen to potential attack along the e-file after Re1 puts pressure on it, indicating a potential blunder.",1. e4 e5 2.

! - A terrible kick on the head of Belavenets!,True,"

The comment accurately describes the player's move as a poor choice, likening it to a ""kick in the head,"" which suggests a significant and blatantly unwise move in the context of the game.",1. e4 e5 2.

"! - Gaining important tempi, taking the initiative and removing White's advantage of the Bishop pair.",False,"
