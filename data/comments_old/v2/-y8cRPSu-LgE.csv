"As opening theory (even in the commonly played Open Games) was not well developed in the late nineteenth century, a critical analysis of the opening phase is redundant.",False,"

"Nevertheless, this is quite a ""modern ""idea as Black refrains from blocking the field of action from his Bg7, with for example 6...d6, followed by 7...Nf6.",False,"

More aggressive is 7.Qd2 0-0 8.0-0-0. The text has the idea of hindering d7-d5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it suggests that the move 7.Qd2 does not immediately support the d4 pawn or counter the opponent's potential d7-d5 thrust, indicating a lack of aggressive support for Black's central pawns.",1. e4 e5 2.

"This leaves the Be3 unprotected and a tactical liability in some variations. A more modern approach might be 9.Re1 when the bishop on c4 can retreat to f1, if need be.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the vulnerability of the Be3 bishop and suggests a more modern approach using 9.Re1.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3.

A more contemporary strategy could involve Re1, allowing the bishop on c4 to move back to f1 if required."
Better is 10.Be2.,True,"

The comment accurately evaluates the mistake by suggesting an alternative move, 10.Be2, which is a stronger positioning of the bishop and potentially leads to a better game strategy.",1. e4 e5 2.

"With this pawn break, Black equalizes easily. As play unfolds, we will see that Black develops an initiative by virtue of having the more active minor pieces.",True,"

"White cannot play 11.e5? because of 11...c5, followed by the pawn fork 12...d4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the potential pawn fork after 11...c5, which would put White in a disadvantageous position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 exd4 5.

"A very strong move, threatening 14...c5, so White must move his queen off the d-file.",False,"

"Black has the incidental threat of 16...Bxd4 17.Bxd4 Rxd4, thus he gains more time.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights a tactical opportunity missed, resulting in a loss of time for Black.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 exd4 5.

"Over the next few moves, we will see the Steinitzian strategy for play with the bishop pair at work. He starts by driving the White knight into passivity by using judicious pawn advances to remove potential advanced knight outposts from the picture. These same pawn advances will gain a space advantage for Black that will last into the endgame. Black's bishops will become more powerful, and Black's king will be easier to activate in the endgame, so Black's advantage is a lasting one, and a difficult one for White to neutralize.",False,"
