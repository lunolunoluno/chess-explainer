"Znosko-Borovsky is probably best remembered today for four books that served as texts for the pre-war generation of Soviet players: How to Play the Chess Openings, The Middle Game in Chess, How to Play Chess Endings, and the delightful and irreverent How Not to Play Chess. Mieses, too, was the author of several books including The Chess Pilot, Manual of the End Game, and Instructive Positions from Master Chess. Mieses had a hearty dislike of ""long lines,"" theoretical openings analyzed so deeply that anyone with a good memory could find his way through them. He would frequently trot out the Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3!?) in international competition. Here, he heads for a variation of the Vienna Game that was not sufficiently well explored at that time. His opponent's unfamiliarity with this sideline soon nets Mieses a significant positional advantage.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the player's use of the Danish Gambit, which was not well explored at the time and resulted in a significant positional advantage for the opponent due to their unfamiliarity with this sideline.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"," Znosko-Borovsky is known for their instructive books on chess strategy. Mieses was also an author, known for his practical approach to chess. The move White made was a Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3). This choice of opening was unconventional and unexpected, exploiting Black's lack of familiarity with the variation. As a result, White gained a significant positional advantage."
"Znosko-Borovsky passes up the opportunity to test Mieses with 3...Nxe4. While it is generally considered harmless for White to take the Knight (4.Nxe4 d5! gets back the piece with a spatial advantage for White), Mieses might well have essayed 4.Nf3!? Nxc3 5.dxc3, the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit, or the extremely complicated lines beginning with 4.Qh5!? Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5!?, which lead to almost unfathomable tactics.",True,"

The comment explains that by not taking the opportunity to challenge Mieses, Znosko-Borovsky missed a chance to potentially gain a significant positional advantage for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"," Znosko-Borovsky, playing as Black, missed a chance to challenge Mieses, White, by not capturing the Knight with 3...Nxe4. While White is usually not at risk by taking the Knight, Mieses could have opted for more aggressive alternatives like 4.Nf3!? leading to the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit or the intricate lines with 4.Qh5!? Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5!, which involve complex tactics."
"As an interesting aside, White often reaches this position via the Bishop's Opening without giving Black the opportunity to take on e4, thus: 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nc3, etc.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it clarifies that White did not allow Black the opportunity to take on e4, which would have been a more common and reasonable opening move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d3"," In this position, White's last move of Pawn to d3 is not strategically sound. It neglects the opportunity to engage in the Bishop's Opening, which would prevent Black from developing their knight to c6 and challenging White's central pawns directly. By not pressing the central file, White allows Black the chance to control the center and develop their pieces freely."
"Here 4...Bc5 would probably transpose into a King's Gambit Declined -- an opening, however, with which the veteran gambitteer Mieses could be expected to be familiar. Znosko-Borovsky's move is designed to start a fight in the center focused on the d5 square. By pinning White's N/c3, Black obtains presumptive control of d5 and is prepared to push his pawn there next move. After, for example, 5.Ne2 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5, Black has achieved the favorable ""Jump Formation"" in the center and can look forward to the middlegame with confidence thanks to his spatial advantage.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting a strategic flaw in the player's move, discussing the potential transpositional opportunities, and outlining the advantages Black should gain in the center with the move 4...Bc5.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4"," 'Znosko-Borovsky (Black) played Bishop to b4, likely seeking to challenge White in the center around d5. However, this move may not be strategically sound as it neglects the immediate threat posed by White's position. It doesn't leverage White's existing setup and could lead to a disadvantage as White continues to develop and consolidate their position, potentially gaining better control of the center and more space.'"
"Mieses, not to be outdone, counters by reducing Black's own control over d5.",True,"

The comment correctly highlights a mistake made by the player, as Mieses' move (a knight move to e5) indeed reduces Black's control over the central d5 square.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5"," In response to White's move, Black attempts to diminish White's influence over the crucial d5 square."
"This is such a natural-looking move that it is difficult to condemn it. Yet Alekhine, in his annotations to the game Alekhine-Gregory, St. Petersburg, 1909, suggests that Black's strongest course is an immediate 5...h6! with the idea 6.Bxf6 Bxc3+! (before White can play Ne2) 7.bxc3 Qxf6, with equal chances. On the other hand, if White were to meet 5...h6 with 6.Bh4, Black could continue 6...g5 7.Bg3 d5! and, having driven off White's Bishop, he would achieve his central goal and have no further worries.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights a more favorable move (5...h6!) that would have put Black in a better position and provided equal chances, according to Alekhine's annotations.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6"," This move doesn't look particularly strong. An alternative, stronger move for Black could be 5...h6 followed by 6...Bxc3+, which would give Black equal chances. If White plays 5...h6, Black might continue with 6...g5 followed by 7...d5, taking control of the center and neutralizing White's bishop."
"Now that Mieses has taken the time to defend the N/c3 with a fellow steed, the idea of ...h6 is less appealing. White can recapture on c3 with a Knight, and Black's Queen would be exposed after her recapture on f6 since White plans both Nd5 (hitting f6 and c7) and 0-0 with f4! coming.",True,"
The comment accurately describes the tactical downfall of Black after White recaptures on c3 with a Knight, as it highlights the subsequent threats of Nd5 and f4+ aimed at the exposed Black Queen.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"," Here's the reformulated comment:

White's move to Knight on e2 is not the best choice. It exposes the Queen after Black's counter with f6. The Knight can recapture on c3, and White can follow with Nd5 to pressure Black's position, as well as preparing for f4."
"The tension this move introduces is quite characteristic of Vienna and Giuoco Piano positions. Tarrasch was one of the first people to note that White should not, as a rule, capture on e6: although it doubles Black's pawns, the pawns control important central squares (like d5 -- there's that square again!) and the open f-file is an asset for Black. The two paths most commonly taken are Bb3, defending the B comfortably with the a-pawn, and Mieses's more daring plan here:",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it analyzes a different opening position (Vienna/Giuoco Piano) rather than the current position on the board.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6",-
"Mieses simply completes his development. If Black captures on c4, White will have a death-grip on the d5 square. This is highly uncomfortable for Black! So Znosko-Borovsky puts the question to White's B/g5 instead. Yet perhaps the best move of all for Black is simply 7...Bxc3. This is a difficult point to understand unless you really grasp the niceties of the pawn formation. Black's darksquare Bishop is outside his pawn chain, true: yet it hasn't much of a future where it stands. In the subsequent course of the game, it serves as more of a punching bag for White than an offensive piece. Trading it off might have been the better part of valor.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic implications of the Mieses move, indicating that Black can counter it effectively with 7...Bxc3, despite the apparent weakness it creates for Black's darksquare Bishop.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"," White completes their development. If Black captures on c4, White gains control over the d5 square, putting Black in a difficult position. White then questions Black's bishop by playing B/g5, but Black's best move might actually be 7...Bxc3. This move seems counterintuitive since Black's dark-square bishop isn't directly involved in the pawn chain. However, in the following game, it becomes more of a target for White's pieces, rather than an active participant in Black's strategy. Trading off the bishop could have been a more strategic decision."
"Already, the B/b4 looks like it is ""floating"" without a purpose. Mieses captures on d5 with his Bishop for a good reason. There is nothing to be gained immediately by kicking Black's N/c6 with a pawn; and long-term, the pawn on d5 might become a liability. Mieses is planning to push f4 soon, harassing Black's Queen and opening a critical file. Notice how weak the f7 square would be if there were no White f-pawn!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the lack of coordination and purpose behind the pawn move, as well as the strategic disadvantages it creates for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on d5"," White captured on d5 with their Bishop, which wasn't necessary. Pushing a pawn on f4 soon would pressure Black's Queen and create an open f-file. However, this move risks making the f7 square vulnerable if the White f-pawn isn't there to support it."
"This prepares for the eventual advance of White's d-pawn. The idea is to soften up the center with f4 first, and if the Black e-pawn can be deflected, then d4 will establish a dominant center for White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic rationale behind the move, indicating that it is part of a plan to control the center and create opportunities for d4.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c6 with check"," The move did not prepare for White's d-pawn's advance effectively. White needs to carefully maneuver their pieces to control the center. A typical strategy involves playing f4 to challenge the center, but it should only be done after ensuring that Black's defense is weakened, allowing d4 to be played without compromising White's position."
As advertised: White is preparing f4.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that White's move was expected to prepare for a f4 pawn push, which suggests that the player has overlooked the potential consequences or missed a better move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to h1"," White's move of moving the king to h1 was an ill-advised action, as it weakened their position unnecessarily."
"Here Mieses makes a small mis-step, which his opponent declines to capitalize on.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Mieses, as it indicates a minor error that the opponent did not take advantage of.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f4", Mieses plays a move that Black doesn't immediately take advantage of.
"This dares Black to snatch a pawn on b2. Yet he might as well grab some booty for his troubles. Mieses could have avoided all of this with 14.d4! and 15.Rxf4, transposing into something like the game continuation without offering Black that opportunity.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the weakness created on Black's b2 pawn and suggests an alternative move to avoid it.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on f4"," White's move, rook on f4, challenges Black to capture a pawn on b2. However, this is not in White's best interest. White could have advanced the game favorably by playing 14.d4! and then following up with 15.Rxf4, which leads to a transposition. This alternative move would have set up a potentially better position without giving Black the chance to seize the b2 pawn."
Black ducks the challenge. Now White's plan rolls forward unhindered.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Black, recognizing that they missed an opportunity to counter White's strategy effectively.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7", Black played a passive move by moving their Queen to e7. This allowed White to continue their strategy without any interruptions.
"What should White play if Black puts the Bishop on d6 now? 15...Bd6 is not the game continuation, but it is worth looking at. The key to this position, as is so often the case in chess, is an undefended man -- here, the pawn on c6. Black's problem is that his Bishop can be forced to go to an undefended square as well, and White can then fork the B and the P. 16.e5 Bb4 17.c3 Ba5 18.Qa4 ... and Black must lose a piece since allowing the fork on c6 is out of the question. For this reason, Black must put his Bishop on b6.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the strategic disadvantage of placing the Bishop on d6 and the potential for White to fork the unprotected pawn on c6.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," White should avoid playing 15...Bd6. Although this move might seem logical, it falls short in the face of White's strategy. The pivotal issue here is the undefended pawn on c6, which stands vulnerable. White has the opportunity to exploit this by threatening a fork with their Queen and Bishop, effectively trapping Black's Bishop and pawn. The move 16.e5 followed by 17.c3, and then the Bishop retreating to a5, leaves Black in a challenging position as they're unable to fend off the fork on c6. Consequently, Black is advised to aim for a different square for the Bishop, such as b6, to mitigate the risk of losing material."
But now we can see clearly the sense in which this piece is more of a target than an asset.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, implying that the move made the piece vulnerable and potentially leading to a loss.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5.

"Znosko-Borovsky is well aware that the Kingside is an unwelcome home for him, so he spirits his King away to the other side. The castle on the west side of his domain is drafty, but he counts on the fact that he has a clerical defender there and White's pieces are not aimed properly for an assault on the Queenside.",False,"

This helps to explain Black's next move, which is otherwise an incomprehensible opening of lines against his own King.",True,"
