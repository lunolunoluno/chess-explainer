"B84: Sicilian Scheveningen: 6 Be2 a6, lines without early Be3",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that the move 6...Be2 does not follow the typical lines of the Sicilian Scheveningen, which usually involve an early Be3.",1. e4,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Polgar, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," White's move, B84, plays into the Sicilian Scheveningen variation. Both Black and White are known for their strategic depth in this opening. However, the play of 6 Be2 by White shows a lack of understanding of the early Be3 move. This move does not contribute to the development of pieces or control of the center, which are vital in the early stages of the game."
Threatening mate... how?,True,"

The comment suggests that the player made a move that appeared to be a threatening mate, but due to a critical oversight, it didn't work out, hence explaining the mistake made.",1. e4 c5 2.

Bg6 Bg7 20. Bxh7,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Polgar, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on h7"," Black's last move by White's bishop to h7 appears to be a serious tactical error, potentially leading to checkmate on the next turn."
Threatening mate: Rf3,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as the move ""Rf3"" does not itself threaten mate, it simply places the rook on f3.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7.

Do you see the mate threat?,True,"

The comment ""Do you see the mate threat?"" indicates that the player might have overlooked a critical threat of checkmate, which is a common reason for a chess move to be evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

Theme: Clearance for d1-f1,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only describes a potential strategic idea without addressing the specific error in the move.",1. e4 c5 2.
