"A rare continuation, which was played in the 1986 Soviet Union Ch. between Efimov - Kuzmin. White continued with 6.g4 Bg6 7.Nc3 e6 8.Qd2 h5 9.g5 Nd7 10. 0-0-0 and had the edge.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it describes a rare continuation played in a specific past game, indicating that this move was not standard, possibly leading to an unexpected or inferior position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bf4 d5 4. e3 Bf5 5. f3 Nd6,"This is a game between Beecham, C R. (as White) and Reeman, I. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d6"," A dubious strategy was employed by the White player, which was notably showcased in a 1986 Soviet Union Ch. match. The sequence unfolded as follows: White made a risky pawn advance with 6.g4, Black responded with Bg6, and White continued with Nc3 and e6. The play escalated as White pushed their pawn to h5, Black mirrored with Nd7, and proceeded with a King's Indian set-up with 0-0-0. This aggressive pawn structure by White, while ambitious, offered little compensation for the potential weaknesses it created around their King."
