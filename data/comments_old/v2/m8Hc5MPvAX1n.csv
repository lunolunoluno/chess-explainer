Black can try and make use of the omission of h2-h3 by White and play 7...Bg4.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by White, suggesting that Black can exploit White's missed opportunity by playing 7...Bg4.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Smirin,I (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6", 'Playing 7...Bg4 is not recommended for Black as it allows White to exploit the lack of h2-h3 by launching an attack on Black's kingside.'
Nowadays 9...a6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.Bf4 Qe7 12.0-0 is quite popular.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it indicates the sequence of moves leading to a less popular and arguably inferior position against the main lines of the Ruy Lopez opening.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6 8. h3 exd5 9. cxd5 b5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Smirin,I (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5", Nowadays 9...a6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.Bf4 Qe7 12.0-0 is not recommended. This sequence of moves does not capitalize on the development of White's pieces and allows Black to gain a comfortable position.
10.Nxb5?! is dubious after 10...Nxe4! 11.Bxe4 Qa5+ 12.Nc3 Bxc3+ 13.bxc3 Re8 which is good for Black.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake and provides a strong follow-up move by Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6 8. h3 exd5 9. cxd5 b5 10.

Black responds with 10...Nxe4, challenging White's bishop. Then White moves the bishop, and Black answers with a check 11...Qa5+. White moves the knight to c3, to which Black recaptures with the bishop, gaining material advantage. Finally, Black's rook moves to e8, solidifying their position and highlighting the weaknesses in White's strategy."
"Forced, as are the next moves.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the next moves are forced, not the previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7.

If 13...Qd3!? 14.N2c4 Qxd1+ 15.Kxd1 Rd8 16.Bg5!,True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake by showing a better move that the player could have made after 13...Qd3.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7.

Black responds by placing the rook at d8, and then White plays Bg5, which is not particularly strong, but it does develop a piece and prepares for potential tactical opportunities.'"
This is best.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake since it contradicts the evaluation of the move as a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6 8. h3 exd5 9. cxd5 b5 10.

White's knights must be challenged.,False,"

The comment does not directly address or explain the mistake made by the player; it merely suggests a general strategy of challenging the opponent's knights.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4.

Weak is 16.Qd3? when 16...Nxc4 17.Nxc4 Bf5 18.Qe2 Rfe8 gives Black too much activity.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the weakness of the move 16.Qd3, offering a better alternative that increases Black's activity and poses more challenges for White.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4.

After 16...Nxc4, White's position becomes vulnerable with 17.Nxc4 allowing Black to bring the bishop to f5, giving Black significant activity and potentially leading to a strong attack."
Tal played 16...Qxb6 and after 17.Nxc8 Rfxc8 Black has good pressure for the pawn.,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the mistake was made by not realizing that after 16...Qxb6 and 17.Nxc8, Black will have strong pressure on the pawn.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6 8. h3 exd5 9. cxd5 b5 10. Bxb5 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 Qa5+ 12. Nfd2 Qxb5 13. Nxd6 Qa6 14. N2c4 Nd7 15. O-O Nb6 16.

As Korchnoi has often stated about these kind of bishop moves - it's really only half a move as the poor bishop will have to move again later.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the double responsibility of the bishop in the move, which is likely to lead to a disadvantageous position due to the bishop having to move again.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 e6 8. h3 exd5 9. cxd5 b5 10. Bxb5 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 Qa5+ 12. Nfd2 Qxb5 13. Nxd6 Qa6 14. N2c4 Nd7 15. O-O Nb6 16. Nxb6 axb6 17. Re1 Bd7,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Smirin,I (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d7"," In this game, White (Browne,W) and Black (Smirin,I) are playing. After Black's last move, placing their Bishop on d7, it's clear that this isn't the best strategy. As Korchnoi has pointed out, such bishop moves are often just a temporary fix. A bishop usually needs to change squares to be effective, so placing it on d7 means it's likely to be moved again soon."
White has a crushing attack after the weakening 19...f5? 20.Rxg7+ Kxg7 21.Qc3+ Rf6 (21...Kg8 22.Bh6 wins) 22.Bh6+! Kxh6 23.Qxf6 Ra8 24.Nf7+ Kh5 25.Qg5 mate.,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the tactical sequences that lead to a checkmate.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Bd3 O-O 7.

Qf3 b5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Smirin,I (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"," Black played an aggressive pawn move to b5, which weakened their position. White capitalized on this by following up with a powerful series of moves: 19...f5?, which allowed White to execute a pinning move with 20.Rxg7+, forcing Black's king to g7. White then proceeded with 21.Qc3+, pinning Black's rook and threatening mate. Black's best attempt, 21...Kg8, was countered by 22.Bh6, putting the black king under direct threat. Black's move 22...Kxh6 led to 23.Qxf6, and Black's position became untenable with 24.Nf7+ winning the king. The final move, 25.Qg5, delivered checkmate."

Putting more coals on the fire!,True,"
Explanation: The comment ""Putting more coals on the fire!"" is a clear metaphor indicating that the player has made a move that worsens their situation instead of improving it.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4.

Another option, 21...Rxf6 after White's Qxf6, results in 22.Qc3+ followed by 22...Qf6, where White maintains the initiative and puts pressure on Black.
