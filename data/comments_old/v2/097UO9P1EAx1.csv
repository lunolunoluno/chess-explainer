Alekhine's defence with reversed colours against Alekhine! Reti never repeated this experiment.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake, as it simply states the historical relevance of the opening without assessing the player's move quality.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3,-
(9....c5 10. N4b3 is good for White because of Nxc5 and cxd5 threats.),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as the move N4b3 allows Black to capture the white knight with Nxc5, followed by cxd5, which puts White in a disadvantageous position.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a6," The move 10. N4b3 by White was not ideal since it allowed Black to capture the knight with 10... Nxd5, which is a good defensive response, and further opens up White's position."
Taking the pawn is always bad because 17. Bxh3 Qxh3 18. Nxb72 Ng4 19. Nf3 Nde3 $3 20. Fxe3 Nxe3 21. Qxf7+ Kh8! 22. Nh4 Rf8 and threat on 'f1' is deadly.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it outlines the consequences of the pawn capture, leading to a potential checkmate threat.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f3," The move was poor because Black could respond with 17...Qxh3, which leads to a series of tactical threats. If White captures the pawn with 18.Nxb7, Black can play 18...Ng4, pinning the knight to the queen. Then 19.Nf3 can be met with 19...Nd3, attacking the bishop. If White parries with 20.Fxe3, Black has 20...Nxe3, trapping the white queen. A subsequent Qxf7+ will force the white king to safety, but Black can threaten the 'f1' square with 22.Nh4, followed by Rf8, showing how Black forces White into a dangerous position."
Giving option of a draw or exchange fianchetto bishop. But Reti chose an inferior option.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that Reti made a suboptimal choice between a draw offer or exchanging the fianchettoed bishop, which was a mistake.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to h3, 'Reti (as White) missed an opportunity for a more strategic position. Choosing a draw or exchanging the fianchetto bishop would have been the better move.'
Keeping an eye on the 'g3' Pawn.,False,"

This comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely suggests focusing on a pawn without identifying or describing the error in the previous move.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3 19.

This spectacular move not only stops White's attack but puts him into deep trouble. Of course the Rook can't be taken because of ...Qxg3+ and ...Nxe3. Now serious threat is 27...Rxg3+.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the tactical consequences of the move and the potential threats to the opponent, which led to the move being evaluated as a mistake.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to e3," The move by Black was poor because it leaves White's king in a vulnerable position. The rook cannot be captured due to the checks from...Qxg3+ and...Nxe3. Now, White must deal with the serious threat of 27...Rxg3+."
(27. kh2?? Raa3! 28.Ncb3-+ 28 fe3? Ne3 29 Qb4 Nf1+! 28... Qe5! 29 bxc6 bxc6 black is clearly better.),True,"

The comment accurately describes the blunder made by the player by highlighting the forced capture with the queen, which then exposes the rook for a winning combination.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3 19. Bf3 Bg4 20. Bh1 h5 21. b4 a6 22. Rc1 h4 23. a4 hxg3 24. hxg3 Qc7 25. b5 axb5 26. axb5 Re3 27. Nf3,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3," Black's Raa3 is a strong tactical move, threatening White's king. After White's kh2, Black plays Ne3, attacking the knight. White's Ncb3 looks like a mistake, as it sacrifices the knight without a clear follow-up. Black's next move, Qe5, capitalizes on the tactics and White's position. Thus, Black seems to have a significant advantage."
(31. Kf1 Nxg3+ 32. fg Bf3 33. Bxf3 Rxf3+ 34. Kg2 Raa3 35. Rd8+ Kh7 36. Rh1+ Kg6-+),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the sequence of moves that led to the loss of the game.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3 19. Bf3 Bg4 20. Bh1 h5 21. b4 a6 22.

Last move played: White plays King to h2," The last move played by White (Reti) was Kf1, which was poorly executed. After Nxg3+ by Black (Alekhine), White (Reti) fails to protect their king and allows Black (Alekhine) to gain significant positional advantage with Bf3. White (Reti) proceeds with Bxf3, but this move allows Black (Alekhine) to initiate a strong attack with Raa3. White (Reti) continues with Rd8+, which leads to a significant disadvantage for White (Reti) as Black (Alekhine) capitalizes on the weakened position."
The beginning of a new combination aiming at the 'b7' Knight after a series of 12 forced moves.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates the consequences of the move in terms of creating a new combination that targets the opponent's knight on b7.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18.

Kh2 Ne4,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4," ""This move is inaccurate as White is targeting Black's knight on b7, which has been forced into the opening after 12 moves."""
The best defence. If 32. fxe3 Nxd2! Winning an exchange.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a tactical mistake in the move, suggesting a winning opportunity for the opponent through a discovered attack.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3 19. Bf3 Bg4 20.

Rc4,This is a game between Reti (as White) and Alekhine (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to c4," In this scenario, White's move, Rook to c4, is not the best choice. If Black plays Knight to d2, White loses an exchange."
Now Black Knight will occupy 'g4'.,False,"

The comment fails to explain why the move was a mistake, as it only states the outcome of the move without providing an analysis of why the move was strategically incorrect.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 d5 4. d3 exd3 5. Qxd3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 Na6 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. N2b3 c6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bg4 15. Rd2 Qc8 16. Nc5 Bh3 17. Bf3 Bg4 18. Bg2 Bh3 19.

Winning a piece.,True,"

Explanation: The comment ""Winning a piece"" indicates that the opponent made a move that resulted in losing a valuable piece, which can be considered a mistake.",1. g3 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3.
