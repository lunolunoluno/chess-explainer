"This isn't losing, but much more aggressive is 2. Bc4 or 2. Nf3. As it is, your light-squared bishop is now hemmed in. Notice the bishop had 5 legal moves prior to moving your pawn to d3; now it has only one.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by highlighting the loss of mobility for the light-squared bishop and suggesting more aggressive alternatives.",1. e4 e5 2. d3,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d3," White's move pawn to d3 has restricted their light-squared bishop's activity. The bishop previously had five legal moves, but now it has only one option, which is not ideal for their position."
"?? Clearly a bad move by the computer. White will win with best play; I know white didn't, so let's see what white could have done to collect the fullpoint.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the move was poor and suggests that with better play, white could have won.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to g5," It seems like Black played poorly by moving their queen to g5, which doesn't contribute to their strategy. White is likely to gain an advantage with the most effective counter-moves."
"An opening principle is: Don't move a piece twice in the opening without good reason. Clearly move 4 was justified for the free queen! However, the bishop has a good post already on e3. Why not either Nc3 or Nbd2? Remember, when ahead a lot in material, trade pieces! Therefore, white had nothing to fear by a potential BxN by black.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by pointing out that moving the bishop to a better square (e3) could have been more strategically advantageous, and suggests it was unnecessary due to White's material advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d2," White's previous move to d2 seemed aimless; it's crucial to avoid moving a piece twice in the opening without clear purpose. White's bishop on e3 is well-placed. Why not develop the knight to c3 or b2 instead? If you're ahead in material, consider simplifying by exchanging pieces. Despite this, White isn't at risk from Black's potential knight capture on c3."
"The first misstep. Always get developed first, THEN attack. Therefore, Be2, O-O is called for first. Then white has his choice of opening lines with d4 or attacking on the kingside with Qe1-g3, Nh4-f5.",True,"

The comment accurately assesses the mistake by emphasizing the importance of piece development before attacking, and suggests appropriate moves for White to consider in their next turn.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5," ""White's first move is too passive. Getting knights developed out early for White, then focusing on an early king-side attack could be more appropriate. Moving Be2 and castling are safer options before committing to a strong opening strategy like d4 or engaging in an aggressive kingside maneuver such as Qe1-g3 followed by Nh4-f5."""
"A nice move! This denies black any counterplay, and establishes a clamp on the key central square on d5.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it praises the move, suggesting it is a good decision, not a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4,-
"Oops! If you must retreat, retreat TOWARD the center. Nc3 is called for. In addition, if white's knight was on c3, white can advance d4 without having to worry about his e4 pawn (since in that case, the knight would be protecting it).",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of moving the knight to c3 as it doesn't contribute to central control and weakens the position; it also provides a viable alternative move.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to a3," The move Nc3 isn't ideal because it lacks central control. Black should aim to centralize their pieces, making them more active. If White had their knight on c3, they could consider pushing d4, as the knight would naturally defend the e4 pawn, but in this case, that move isn't recommended without further context."
"This isn't right. Just get developed with Be2. Don't worry about 15. ... g4, because Nh4, O-O and Nf5 is strong (notice how if you got developed, your rook would partcipate).",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake by suggesting a better developmental move (Be2) and explaining the consequences of the wrong move (g4), emphasizing the importance of piece development and the potential for a strong position with the suggested moves.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4," White's last move to d4 is not the optimal choice. It would be better to develop with Be2. This way, Black's potential g4 doesn't become a problem, as White's pieces, such as the rook, would actively participate in the play."
"Why? Getting your bishop active is still mandatory. g3 followed by Bg2 or h3, and white would still be winning.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move, suggesting alternative moves to keep the bishop active and still maintain a winning position for white.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3," 'White's move doesn't prioritize activating the bishop. They should consider g3 first to support Bg2 or h3, which would maintain a winning position.'"
"The computer misses a cheapo. White can win a free piece with Qxe4! Notice black cannot take the white queen, because the f-pawn is pinned! It is illegal for black to expose his king to check, so white gets a knight scott free.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the tactical opportunity White has to win a knight for free due to the pin on the f-pawn, preventing black from capturing the queen without exposing the king to check.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c8," White can win a free piece with Qxe4! Black cannot capture the white queen because the f-pawn is pinned. It's illegal for Black to put their king in check. Therefore, white captures a knight for free."
"This hangs a piece. Kg2 was safe and strong... black's f-pawn wasn't going anywhere. Besides, if white had to, he can sac (sacrifice) his rook for pawn and knight, which is still better than losing the bishop for the pawn.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as sacrificing a bishop for a single pawn and knight when the pawn isn't threatening is a poor decision, and the rook's position is indeed safer and stronger.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8 23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays King takes on f2," The move was a mistake. White's king was safe on g2, and Black's f-pawn wasn't threatening. Even if White had to give up a rook and a knight, that's a better outcome than losing the bishop for a pawn."
"Instead, Qxf5+ Ke7 28. h4 would leave white in a strong position.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by pointing out the inaccuracy of Qxf5+ and suggests a better alternative move, h4.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8 23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2 Nxh3+ 25. Kg2 Ng5 26. Rhf1 Rce8 27. Rxf5,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on f5," The move Qxf5+ was a blunder; Black responds with Ke7, but 28. h4 gives White a substantial advantage."
"Too passive. Qf2! is natural and strong. Remember with your heavy pieces (rooks & queens), have them double on an open column, or file. What might happen is 28. Qf2 Ne4 29. Qf3 Ng5 30. Qg4 (threatening Rxg5, discovered check!) Ke7 31. Raf1, getting nearly all white's pieces into the attack. The only straggler is that knight at a3, but he can be rerouted by Nb1- c3.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out that the move was passive, and suggests a stronger alternative move (Qf2!) that would have put pressure on the opposing knight and potentially led to a more active position for White.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8 23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2 Nxh3+ 25. Kg2 Ng5 26. Rhf1 Rce8 27. Rxf5 Nb4 28. Qb1,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to b1," The move Qf2 was too passive. Instead, White should consider placing their rooks and queen on open files or ranks. For example, moving to Qf3 initiates a powerful threat, leading to a potential game-winning sequence: Ne4, Qf3, Ng5, followed by a discovered check with Rxf1, bringing most of White's pieces into the attack. The black knight on a3 can be rerouted with Nb1-c3."
"Not the best. 29. h4, followed by Qe4 and Raf1 would still be very strong.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it acknowledges the move as not the best and provides alternative stronger moves for future consideration.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8 23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2 Nxh3+ 25. Kg2 Ng5 26. Rhf1 Rce8 27. Rxf5 Nb4 28. Qb1 Reg8 29. Nc2,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c2," The move h4 weakens White's pawn structure unnecessarily. Following up with Qe4 and Rf1 would have been a strong sequence, but it's better to focus on developing pieces and controlling the center."
? A poor move by black. Simply 32. ... Nxe6 would force white to resign.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it only states that the move was poor and suggests a hypothetical scenario where a different move would force the opponent to resign.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22. Bh3 Rac8 23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2 Nxh3+ 25. Kg2 Ng5 26. Rhf1 Rce8 27. Rxf5 Nb4 28. Qb1 Reg8 29. Nc2 Kxf5 30. Nd4+ Kf6 31. Qf5+ Ke7 32. Qe6+ Kf8,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8,-
"Instead, 25. Rf1! wins outright! That move would threaten Qxf7#, so therefore black would have to play ...Rf8, but THEN 36. Ne6+ Kg6 37. Qe7 is lights out for black. There is this phrase among tournament chess players, ""Monkey see check, monkey do check"". Don't be a monkey! Only check if there's a concrete reason to do so.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by explaining the consequences of the move and emphasizes the importance of concrete reasons for making checks.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19.

Qxc7+ Nf7 35. Ne6+,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e6 with check," White's move, Rf1, leads to a swift checkmate. If Black moves the rook to Rf8 in response, White can continue with Ne6+ and then Qe7, leaving Black in no position to escape. ""Monkey see, monkey do"" is not a strategy to follow; overlooking check for the sake of it can be costly."
"This was the losing move for white. To have a fighting chance, white had to play 41. Qd7 to protect his knight.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as 41. Qd7 would have protected the knight and potentially improved white's position.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19. Ke2 f5 20. b3 Ke7 21. g3 Kxe6 22.

Rf1 Nxe3+ 38. Kg1 Nxf1 39. Kxf1 b6 40. g4 Re8 41. Qh4,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h4, The move was poor because it left the White knight unprotected. A better move would have been Qd7 to safeguard the knight.
"I want to thank you for sending in this game. Unlike many who send submissions, you sent a loss. This is exactly the kind of game that an individual can get the most out of -- one of his/her draws or losses. It can be humbling at times, and even difficult, but by going over a loss, trying to find out what went wrong, and how to improve, will reap great results. I myself did the same when I was a youth, and by continually going over games that I lost/drew, I found out what I did wrong, and resolved not to repeat them. I did go over wins as well to look for improvements, but rarely did I learn as much. BTW, I have a feeling that if the computer gives you a free queen again, it will be in trouble, because you've learned from your mistakes! Keep up the good fight.",True,"
The comment provides an insightful analysis of the player's mistake by encouraging them to learn from their loss and suggests that reviewing their mistakes will lead to improvement, which is a constructive approach to the game.",1. e4 e5 2. d3 Bc5 3. Be3 Qg5 4. Bxg5 h6 5. Be3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Bc5 7. Be3 Bxe3 8. fxe3 Nf6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. Nc3 d6 11. Nb5 Kd8 12. Qd2 Be6 13. c4 a6 14. Na3 g5 15. d4 g4 16. d5 gxf3 17. dxe6 Nxe4 18. Qc2 f2+ 19.

Kd3,This is a game between W12 (as White) and B12 (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to d3," I want to thank you for sharing this game. It's great to see you engaging with our community, even in instances where you face defeat. Analyzing your game, specifically the move where White played King to d3, shows a strategic misstep. Often, studying your losses or draws can be incredibly enlightening, offering valuable insights into your gameplay. It's through such analysis that players grow and refine their chess skills. As someone who has been down this road, I've learned that repetition of mistakes is a common pitfall. This particular move by White may have offered Black an unexpected advantage, which is a valuable lesson in anticipating your opponent's strategy. If the computer were to make a similar error by giving up a queen, it would likely struggle to recover. Keep challenging yourself, and continue to learn from these experiences. Your dedication is commendable."
