"Since White hasn't yet ""declared"" where Pd2 will be advanced it's not yet clear whether Bf1 will move to g2 (to complement Pc4) or, after d2-d4, go to d3 where it might threaten Black's king-side. Black's next is an ordinary good development move which happens to impede d2-d4 and might be used later ( by ...e5-e4) to fight White's light square bishop. Naturally Black has various plans at his disposal. This is just one. White won't get much of a clue about Black's intentions, so he has to decide what kind of position he wants and go for it.",False,"

"Kasparov has played the King's Indian Defense extensively, but not recently. He's also played the Gruenfeld Defense, but 2...d5 isn't considered all that good, so he finds another choice.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it suggests that Kasparov, experienced with various defenses, is likely to choose a less common or optimal move in this position, deviating from his preferred strategies.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"," In this game, Black (Garri Kasparov) has opted for an unconventional line in the King's Indian Defense, possibly as a surprise element. White (Francisco Vallejo Pons) is trying to navigate this unexpected choice. White's last move, Pawn to e5, does not align with the typical setup of the King's Indian Defense and may not exert the desired pressure on Black's position. The Gruenfeld Defense is also a possibility for Black, but the move 2...d5 is seen as less favorable, possibly due to less common responses or weaker structures it can lead to."
"This certainly weakens the c5-f2 diagonal and makes it less possible to utilize Bf1 offensively, unless he can also achieve d2-d4 without his position falling apart.",True,"

The comment correctly explains that the move weakens the c5-f2 diagonal and limits the mobility of the bishop on f1, indicating it was a strategic mistake.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black).

Black might still aim for d2-d4, but White's position could become vulnerable if not careful."
"Kasparov keeps the pressure on. This is usually intended to get rid of Nc3, so Black won't have to worry about Nc3-d5. However, in this position it threatens to undermine Pe4. That causes White to postpone d2-d4.",True,"

This move typically aims to eliminate Nc3, preventing White from playing Nc3-d5. However, in this position, it poses a threat to the pawn on e4. Consequently, White decides to delay d2-d4."
"He seems intent on limiting Bc8, but in so doing sets up his own position as a target. It's already getting difficult to find a great plan for White. Expanding on the queen-side by a2-a3 would have to be prefaced with Bc1-d2 and Black could generate some king-side offense before that expansion ever becomes a threat. Essentially Black has three minor pieces ready to fight on the king-side (Nc6, Bc8, Nf6) , whereas White has two (Nf3 and Bc1) .",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the over-concentration on limiting the opponent's Bishop, which consequently weakens White's position and reduces the effectiveness of their own pieces, making it easier for Black to generate offensive potential on the king-side.",1. c4 Nf6 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"," White's last move, Pawn to h3, might seem like an attempt to restrict Black's bishop to c8, but this actually opens up White's position for attack. The strategy of advancing a2-a3, which could bolster White's queen-side, would have to be carefully timed with Bc1-d2, as Black can prepare for aggressive king-side play with pieces like Nc6, Bc8, and Nf6. At this moment, Black's minor pieces are poised to challenge White's position, with more readiness on the king-side than White's current setup."
"He's apparently decided he can't play on the wing and must fight in the center with ...c7-c6, ...d6-d5, but to do that he has to reorganize a bit.",True,"

However, this plan miscalculated, as the move allows the opponent's pawn on g2 to support their own pawn on h3. Consequently, the knight's advance to h5 is directly countered by g2-g3, effectively leaving the knight isolated on h5. Therefore, White should reconsider playing Bc1-g5 at this juncture."

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the missed opportunity to strengthen the king's position earlier in the game and acknowledges the advantage gained by Black due to the delayed move.",1. c4 Nf6 2.
