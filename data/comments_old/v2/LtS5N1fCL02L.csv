"White shows his aggressive designs from the very beginning. Akesson had never used this lunge, so to some extent it became a surprise for me, but, frankly speaking, rather pleasant one. Let me a little digression to explain to my readers what these feelings are bound up with. I studied chess at the Leningrad Pioneers' Palace (subscribers of the ""New in Chess"" Magazine could feel its atmosphere with the help of the remarkable essay of Genna Sosonko, dedicated to Vladimir Zak [""A great teacher inspires"" - see NIC 99/5]). A very experienced master Sergey Khavsky was my coach (by the way, a well-known St.Petersburg grandmaster Vladimir Epishin, living now in Germany, was one of his students). Well, master Khavsky inculcated us steadfast disgust for moves like g2-g4 and g7-g5, especially when one makes them at the open position or having a king unprovided for. He often said that ""the only case to play g2-g4 is when you win at least a piece"". We even invented a special term for such a move - ""the anti-Khavsky move"". Accordingly, when an opponent resorts to the move, I feel an insuperable desire to ""punish"" him for this untimely activity and permanently tell myself that ""a pawn doesn't advance back"" and that ""the position weakening must adversaly affect early or late"".",True,"

The comment indicates that the move g2-g4 was against the player's coaching principles and was considered a fundamental mistake, showing a misunderstanding of the player's chess philosophy and strategy.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. g4,"This is a game between Akesson, Ralf (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g4"," White's move g4, although unexpected, evokes a sense of displeasure. This move, often derided by a coach who instilled a deep-seated aversion to such openings, is seen as a weak play, especially unguarded. The strategy of advancing a pawn to g4 typically occurs when a player expects to gain material advantage, but in this instance, the move feels premature. It feels like White is forcing a confrontation on a defensive front that isn't prepared for such an aggressive stance. The strategy is akin to a ""punishment"" for pushing the pawn without securing a position, and it underlines the importance of maintaining a solid defense before advancing one's pawns."
"Had a pawn stayed on g2 instead of g5, the advantage of White would have been incontestable, for he has two bishops and a solid center. But now the weakening of the White's kingside gives Black objects for counterplay. That moment I thought kindly of master Khavsky once more.",True,"

The comment accurately evaluates the mistake made by the player, pointing out the advantage White would have had if the pawn remained on g2 and highlighting the weakening of White's kingside that allows Black for counterplay.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Bb2,"This is a game between Akesson, Ralf (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b2"," Given the recent move by White, placing a bishop on b2, the center control's strength has been compromised. White's position is vulnerable, while Black now has potential targets for counterplay on the White's kingside. The decision to weaken White's position echoes the strategic advice of the great Khavsky."
"If I had imagined what the next move would be I would have preferred 16...Bd5, safely blocking the pawn d.",True,"

The comment indicates that the player missed a defensive opportunity that would have involved protecting the pawn on d, suggesting that they made a mistake by not considering this move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, stating that they gave up a pawn for an exchange, but the commenter believes Black is compensated for the pawn.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Both sides has fully completed development. The very next moves are to show whose trumps are more significant,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player as it focuses more on the overall development of the pieces rather than identifying a specific error in the move played.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

"Judging by my partner's reaction, he had evidently underestimated this simple capture. A bishop boldly stands under the pin, but the open location of the king doesn't let White to derive profits from it.",True,"

The comment accurately reflects the mistake made by the player, as it identifies underestimating a simple capture and the lack of profitable gains from the position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Despite the bishop being attacked, the White king's exposed position did not provide White with any beneficial outcome from this exchange."
"This is lost. After 26. Rg3 White would have kept a defendable position, although it would have been Black who possesses doubtless initiative.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, emphasizing that White's move (26. Rg3) was a missed opportunity to maintain a better position, while still acknowledging Black's initiative.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6.

""White's last move, Bishop to g4, was not strategically sound. Black retains a strong position and initiative."""
"White can't protect his king from coordinate attack of all black pieces. In addition, Akesson was in a terrible time trouble",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the lack of protection for the White king and the influence of time trouble on Akesson's decision-making.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Mate in several moves is inevitable.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the significant consequence of the player's mistake, which is the potential for a checkmate within a few moves.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6.
