B01: Scandinavian Defence,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the use of an unconventional opening known as the Scandinavian Defence, which may indicate a less experienced player making a less strategic choice.",1. e4,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4", Black's move is not strategically sound. A safer option would have been to develop their pieces more effectively.
The main line of the Portuguese Variation of the Scandinavian or Center Counter Opening.,False,"

This comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only describes the opening variation, not the specific error in the move.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g4",-
Other alternatives are 4. Be2 and 4. f3. For example 4. f3 Bf5 5. Bb5+ Nbd7 6. c4 e6 7. dxe6 Bxe6 8. c5! c6 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxb6 Qxb6 11. Ne2 c5 12. O-O! and white stands slightly better.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it provides alternative moves and analyzes the resulting positions, showing that the initial move was inferior.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Nf3,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"," White's choice of 4. f3 is not optimal as it weakens their king's safety. For instance, after 4. f3 Bf5 5. Bb5+ Nbd7 6. c4 e6 7. dxe6 Bxe6 8. c5! c6 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxb6 Qxb6 11. Ne2 c5 12. O-O!, Black has a slightly better position."
"Not a good move, because of dark squares and pressure of white's kingside, better would be something like 7. O-O O-O-O 8. Be3 and so on.",True,"

This comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the weaknesses in their king's position and suggesting a better move to increase the safety of the white king.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Nf3 Qxd5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. c4 Qh5 7. d5,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"," ""White's move to d5 is not optimal. It leaves the dark squares vulnerable and adds kingside pressure. A better option may be to castle kingside with 7. O-O, followed by castling queenside with 8. O-O-O and develop the bishop with 8. Be3."""
"Too aggressive! White has no chance of attack, because his own King-side is weak. More reasonable would be 10. dxe6.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake, highlighting the player's aggressive move and the vulnerability of their own King-side, which makes it a poor decision.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Nf3 Qxd5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. c4 Qh5 7. d5 Ne5 8. Nbd2 O-O-O 9. O-O e6 10. Qa4,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to a4"," It's overly aggressive for White. White's King-side is vulnerable, making this move unsound. A more balanced option would be 10. dxe6."
Too greedy. Rather 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Nf3 Ng4!,True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake by highlighting the player's greediness in an attempt to win material immediately, which led to the aggressive but ill-advised knight move.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Nf3 Qxd5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. c4 Qh5 7. d5 Ne5 8. Nbd2 O-O-O 9. O-O e6 10. Qa4 Bd6 11. h3 Bxh3 12. gxh3 Qxh3 13. Qxa7,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on a7", Better to retreat to safety. White should consider 13. Nxe5 to avoid a knight fork and maintain a solid position.
Or 16. c5 Rh6 17. Qa8+ Kd7 18. Qxd8+ Kxd8 19. Bxh6 Bxc5 with the double threat of Nxf2! and gxh6. If 20. Be3 then 20... Ng3!,True,"

The comment accurately describes the double threat of Nxf2 and gxh6 after 19... Bxc5, showing the player's mistake in not recognizing the consequences of their move.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Nf3 Qxd5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. c4 Qh5 7. d5 Ne5 8. Nbd2 O-O-O 9. O-O e6 10. Qa4 Bd6 11. h3 Bxh3 12. gxh3 Qxh3 13. Qxa7 Nxf3+ 14. Nxf3 Ne4 15. Be3 h5 16. Qa8+,"This is a game between Markkanen, Seppo (as White) and Jarvenpaa, Jari (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to a8 with check"," The move 17. Qa8+ was a mistake because it allows Black to play 17... Kd7, which results in a double threat: Black can capture the White queen with 18... Kxf2, and then Black can take the White bishop with 18... gxh6. This sequence leads to significant material loss for White. Additionally, after 18. Qxd8+ Kxd8, White's position becomes even more vulnerable, as the Black knight can now move to g3 on the next turn, further compounding White's tactical problems."
