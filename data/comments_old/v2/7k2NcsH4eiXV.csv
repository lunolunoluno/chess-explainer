"This is the first deviation from Psakhis-Shirov, of round 7 (two rounds earlier) , where Shirov played 8...Na5.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it identifies the deviation from a game (Psakhis-Shirov) where Shirov made a known strategic move (8...Na5), suggesting that the current player should have considered that move or similar variations.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b8"," Black played a move that was not aligned with their strategy in the game against White. Specifically, Black's decision to play 8...Na5 deviated from the established approach in the Psakhis-Shirov match up from round 7, which occurred two rounds before this game."
Clearly Black wouldn't like to face b2-b4-b5.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a tactical mistake, as advancing the pawn to b2-b4-b5 would expose the b4 pawn to a potential attack from Black's pieces, likely resulting in a losing position for White.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to b1", Alexei (Black) wouldn't favor a b2-b4-b5 sequence.
It would appear this is something especially prepared for Shirov. By preventing ...c7-c5 he undermines Black's plan and still can play b2-b4.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake well because it points out that Black needs to play...c7-c5 to challenge White's pawn structure and opens up the game, but White's move prevents this and continues with their plan of b2-b4.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c5"," White's move to play Pawn to c5 weakens Black's strategy. It restricts Black's potential c7-c5 advance, which could have been a strong central thrust. In response, White can still aim to strengthen their position by playing b2-b4."
The knight would seem to be a little too far afield.,True,"
The comment accurately identifies a potential mistake by pointing out that the knight's position might be out of the optimal range for exerting influence on the board.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c4", Black's knight move to c4 appears premature.
"But, perhaps the same can be said of White's queen! If she had just retreated the game would be interesting, but now it's a walk on a razor's edge.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the potential danger of the current position, where White's queen is in a risky position, making it a critical mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on a6"," Black's move to a6 has been criticized; retreating the queen would have made the game more engaging, but now it's precariously close."
guarding square a8 to prevent ...Rb8-a8 which would trap Qa6,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a potential tactical threat that the player failed to address, indicating that the previous move was indeed a mistake to neglect the defense of square a8.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to h4"," Black's last move to Knight on h4 was risky. It leaves a8 vulnerable to...Rb8-a8, which could have trapped White's Queen on a6."
again threatening ...Ra8,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it indicates the player made a threat by moving the rook to a square that could potentially become a target for the opponent.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c6"," Black's move to c6 was passive, allowing White to maintain control."
"Black has sacrificed two pawns, but will soon regain one by capturing Pc5. So, is the stuck Qa6 good compensation for a one-pawn sacrifice?",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it acknowledges the pawn sacrifice and suggests a possible recovery strategy.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on d7"," Black sacrificed a pawn with the move, but this can be compensated by taking Pc5 later. However, the current Qa6 is not a sufficient compensation for the pawn sacrifice."
How about for a two-pawn sacrifice? It's not at all clear Black can forcibly regain the material or win Qa6. At least there's the immediate threat to Nb5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it points out the unclear consequences of the pawn sacrifice and the potential threat to the opponent's knight.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on c5"," San Segundo Carrillo, playing as White, might consider offering two pawns to gain an advantage. However, it's not evident that Black can recover the pawns or claim a material win with Qa6. There's a looming danger, though, as White threatens to capture on b5 with a piece."
threatening Re1 and probably preparing ...Nd7-c5-b3xc1 to undermine all of White's queen-side pawns. How Black might do all this and somehow switch the play toward Kg1 is as yet unclear.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential threats Black is preparing in the queen-side while also pointing out the unclear strategic intent behind Black's moves.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b4"," Black's last move threatens White's Re1 and sets up a potential plan to advance...Nd7-c5-b3xc1 against White's queen-side pawns. The strategy to disrupt White's pawn structure is somewhat ambiguous, with unclear intentions to pivot play towards Kg1."
All of White's pieces are targets and they can't coordinate to do anything together!,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as the loss of coordination among White's pieces would likely lead to a lack of effective defense or counterplay.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21. Qc6 Nxa4 22. Nc7 Rfc8 23. Bf4 e5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5", The move played by Black was poor because all of White's pieces are vulnerable and cannot collaborate effectively.
providing a support point where Qc6 can escape (a4 or c4),True,"

The comment appropriately identifies the mistake by suggesting a potential escape square for the queen, indicating the opponent's move was weak and left the queen vulnerable.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21. Qc6 Nxa4 22. Nc7 Rfc8 23. Bf4 e5 24. Be3 Rb7 25. b3,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3"," The move played by White was a mistake because it fails to protect the pawn on c6, allowing Black to potentially exploit the weakness with moves like a4 or c4."
Shirov is keeping White's queen tied to Nc7 and blocking the c-file to prevent the queen from retreating or being supported by a rook. That he threatens Rb1 is also good.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies Shirov's strategic intentions and highlights the mistake by pointing out the queen's vulnerable position and potential threats.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21. Qc6 Nxa4 22. Nc7 Rfc8 23. Bf4 e5 24. Be3 Rb7 25. b3 Nc3,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c3"," White's move is commendable for maintaining the queen's position on Nc7, thus limiting Black's options. The blocking of the c-file is strategic, as it curtails the queen's retreat and hinders rook support. The threat of Rb1 by Black is an added advantage."
"But, it cost White an exchange to clear the board and he's surely lost in the ending.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as exchanging a rook for a knight and a bishop could lead to a disadvantageous ending for the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21.

Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on b1"," 'This move resulted in White losing an exchange, which likely compromises their position in the endgame.'"
threatening ...Nd6+,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it only describes a potential threat, not the error in the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21. Qc6 Nxa4 22. Nc7 Rfc8 23.

Nb5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5",-
Black threatens ...Na4-b2xc4 and it is probably going to be very difficult or impossible for White to defend the pawn when his bishop can't help directly.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the tactical threat of...Na4-b2xc4, which if realized, would create a significant disadvantage for White due to the loss of the bishop's support.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21.

Nb5 Bc5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5"," Black's move to c5 opens a line that White's bishop cannot cover, making it challenging for White to protect the pawn if it advances to b2."
"It's a little unusual for someone to make a move and then resign (not unheard of, just unusual) , so I don't know whether White resigned here or perhaps lost by time forfeit. But, Pc4 is weak, so he may have forseen a concrete variation where it's lost. Without that pawn White can't hold back Black.",True,"

The comment provides a reasonable explanation for the resignation by highlighting the weakness of the pawn on c4 and suggesting the possibility of a future loss.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 Rb8 9. Rb1 Na5 10. Qa4 b6 11. c5 Bd7 12. Qa3 Nc4 13. Qxa6 b5 14. Nh4 dxc5 15. dxc5 c6 16. Bxc6 Qc7 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. Nxb5 Qxc5 19. a4 Qb4 20. Ng2 Nc5 21.
