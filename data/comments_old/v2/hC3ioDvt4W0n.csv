C95: Closed Ruy Lopez: Breyer Variation with 10 d4,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by identifying the specific opening variation, the Closed Ruy Lopez Breyer Variation, and the move that deviated from the expected path, which is 10 d4.",1. e4,"This is a game between Polgar, J. (as White) and Spassky, B. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," Polgar, as White, opted for 10 d4, which is an unconventional move in the Closed Ruy Lopez, Breyer Variation. This choice is often considered suboptimal."

Black wins space,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it indicates that their move resulted in gaining more space, which would be considered a mistake if it compromises their position or leads to a loss of control.",1. e4 e5 2.
