"This is the so-called Steiner system, a sister of the Panov Attack. The usual continuation is 3...cxd5. By sacrificing a pawn, black gets compensation in his active piece play. But white declines the sacrifice, preferring to direct the game in a familiar mold.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it correctly identifies the choice of 3...cxd5 by black and the potential compensation for the sacrificed pawn, as well as the reason behind white's decision to avoid the sacrifice.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A (as White) and Wells, P (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"," White decided not to take advantage of the pawn sacrifice by Black, which typically leads to active piece compensation. Instead, White chose to play a more traditional game."
By transposition we have arrived at one of the best-known positions of the Panov Attack. The traditional move order is 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Nf3 Bg4 7.cxd5 Nxd5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the common move order of the Panov Attack as a contrast to the player's move, indicating that the player deviated from the standard opening theory.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. Nf3 Bg4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A (as White) and Wells, P (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g4"," After Black's last move of playing Bishop to g4, the position has shifted into one of the Panov Attack's familiar structures. This particular configuration is the result of the usual sequence of moves that Black plays following White's pawn to d4. In this scenario, White has played pawn to d4, Black has responded with pawn to d5, White proceeds with pawn to exd5, and then Black captures back with cxd5. After White develops their knight to c3 and Black develops their knight to c6, White plays knight to f3. Subsequently, Black chooses to develop their bishop to g4, which leads to this current position.

The move played by Black, Bishop to g4, is considered suboptimal in this context. It overextends the bishop, potentially putting it on the long diagonal where it can become a target. Furthermore, this move does not contribute to Black's central control or development and may lead to a weakness in Black's pawn structure should White capitalize on this by placing pressure on the e4 pawn."
"The ancient move 8.Bb5, which goes back to Nimzovich-Alekhine (Bled 1931), has a worthy defense, as shown by Nimzovich himself: 8...Rc8! 9.h3 Bxf3 10.Qxf3 e6 11.0-0 Be7.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move 8.Bb5 is a less common choice in modern chess and highlights a specific defense strategy that can lead to a successful game if executed well, thus explaining the perceived mistake.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Qb3,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A (as White) and Wells, P (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to b3"," They played the move 8.Bb5, a reference to Nimzovich-Alekhine from 1931. Nimzovich himself showed it's not strong: Black responds with 8...Rc8, White plays 9.h3, Black captures the bishop with 9...Bxf3, and after 10.Qxf3, Black advances with 10...e6. This sequence suggests that the initial move was quite unfavorable for White."
"Here, black was at a crossroads. He prefers, in this game, the most popular continuation - a forced transition into the endgame. A sharp middlegame, but with a certain risk for black, awaits him after 9...Nb6 10.d5. It is easier for black to defend after 10.Be3 e6 11.0-0-0 Be7 12.d5 exd5 13.Bxb6 Qxb6 14.Qxb6 axb6 15.Nxd5 Rxa2 16.Kb1 Ra5! with an equal endgame. In Anand-Karolyi (Frunze 1987), white chose to keep the bishop: 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.Rxd5 Qc7 15.Kb1 0-0 16.f4 Nb4! 17.Rd4 Nc6 18.Rd1 Bf6 19.Bg2, but it seems that black's position is quite defensible. After 10.d5 Nd4 11.Qd1 e5 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Be3 Bc5, we arrive at the extremely sharp position shown in the analysis The practice of the last several years shows that black can maintain equality. Here are several examples: 1) 14.Bg2 Qh4 15.0-0 Bd6 16.h3 Nf5 17.Qb3 0-0 18.Qxe6+ Kh8 19.Qe4 Qf6 20.Qg4 Qf7 and black has sufficient compensation for the pawn (Malaniuk-Yudasin, USSR Championship, Moscow 1991), or 2) 14.b4 0-0 15.bxc5 Nxf3+ 16.Ke2 Qf6 17.cxb6 (17.Bg2?! Nc4! is in black's favor) 17...Rad8 18.Qc2 Nd4+ 19.Bxd4 Qxd4 20.Ne4 Qxa1 21.Bg2 Qe5 with mutual chances (Hansen,L-Kuijf, Graested 1990).",True,"

The comment accurately evaluates that after 9...Nb6, black's position becomes more defensible and offers equal opportunities, as demonstrated in various practical examples.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Qb3 Bxf3 9. gxf3 e6,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A (as White) and Wells, P (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6"," In this game, Black faced a tough decision. They would usually opt for the most common sequence, which leads to an endgame. However, this path involves some risks. After 9...Nb6, Black might play 10...Nd4, but White has a strong response with 11.d5, threatening to force Black out of the game. The game of Anand-Karolyi (Frunze 1987) shows that White's choice to keep the bishop with 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.Rxd5 Qc7 15.Kb1 0-0 16.f4 Nb4 is strong. Even so, Black's position can be well defended. Another sharp position arises from 10...Nd4, where Black might try to maintain balance after 14.Bg2 Qh4 15.0-0 Bd6 16.h3 Nf5 17.Qb3 0-0 18.Qe4 Qf6. Black has good compensation for the pawn in this scenario (from Mal"
"For a short time, the capture 13.Nxb5 aroused some curiosity. The idea is that 12...a6 13.Nd4 is unpleasant for black due to the threat of 14.Bg5+.

The comment provides a clear explanation for the mistake made by the player, as it shows a potential alternative response from Black that could have been played, indicating the move's lack of success.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

Last move played: White plays Queen takes on b5"," White's 13.Nxb5 momentarily garnered interest, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The idea behind the move is that if Black plays 12...a6, then White's 13.Nd4 would pose a dilemma for Black, threatening the potential for 14.Bg5+. However, the game Zhuravlev-Stecko (USSR 1971) shows that this move is ineffective, as after the following sequence: 13...Rb8!, 14.Nd4 Qd7, 15.Be3 Rxb2, 16.Qc4 f6, 17.Rd1 Kf7, 18.Nb3 Be7, Black managed to maintain an advantage despite the initial threats from White."
"The natural-looking intermediate exchange 13...Nxc3 14.bxc3 with the goal of compromising white's pawn structure turns out to favor white. The b-file opens up, and the white rook puts it to good use. Black, meanwhile, experiences difficulty in completing his kingside development. The game Fischer-Euwe (Leipzig Olympiad 1960) serves as an excellent illustration of white's play in an ending of this type: 14...Qd7 15.Rb1! Rd8?! (more tenacious is 15...Qxb5 16.Rxb5 Kd6, although after 17.Rb7 the rook is boss on the seventh rank) 16.Be3 Qxb5 17.Rxb5 Rd7 18.Ke2 f6 19.Rd1! Rxd1 20.Kxd1 Kd7 21.Rb8 Kc6 22.Bxa7 g5 23.a4, and the extra passed pawn decided the fate of the game. 14...f6 looks stronger, preparing the evacuation of the king: 15.Qb7+ Ke8 16.Rb1 Qc8! is not dangerous, as black plays Kf7 next. If white plays the obvious 15.Ba3+ Kf7 16.Rd1 Qc8 17.Rd7+ Kg8, the king hides from the threats after h7-h5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, showing how the intermediate exchange with the goal of compromising white's pawn structure actually favors white, leading to a strong position and difficulty for black in completing development.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7"," The exchange 13...Nxc3 14.bxc3 weakens White's pawn structure. The b-file becomes open, benefiting the White rook. Black struggles to finish their kingside development. The Fischer-Euwe game from the Leipzig Olympiad 1960 shows how White capitalizes on this. After 14...Qd7 15.Rb1, Black's move 15...Rd8?! is less effective than 15...Qxb5, followed by 16.Rxb5 Kd6, though after 17.Rb7, White's rook dominates the seventh rank. After 14...f6, Black prepares king evacuation, but White's move 15.Qb7+ Ke8 followed by 16.Rb1 Qc8 is not threatening. If White goes for 15.Ba3+ Kf7 16.Rd1 Qc8, Black's king retreats to g8, avoiding threats after h7-h5."
"Sometimes white decides to induce the weakening of black's position with the intermediate 15.Bg5+ f6 16.Qxd5 exd5 17.Be3, and yet this does not give white any advantage. By following the main line of development with 17...Ke6! black keeps the game level. For instance, 18.0-0-0 Bb4 19.a3 Rhc8+ 20.Kb1 Bc5 21.Rhe1 Bxe3 22.Rxe3+ Kd6 23.Rde1 Rc4, and the weakness of the h2 pawn is felt (Belikov-Dreev, Moscow 1992). If 18.Ke2, then 18...Bd6 19.Rhc1 Rhb8! 20.Rc2 Be5 is good.",True,"

Despite initiating a series of moves like 16.Qxd5 exd5 17.Be3, White cannot secure an advantage. By choosing 17...Ke6, Black keeps an equal game. For example, after 18.0-0-0 Bb4 19.a3 Rhc8+ 20.Kb1 Bc5 21.Rhe1 Bxe3 22.Rxe3+ Kd6 23.Rde1 Rc4, the vulnerability of White's h2 pawn becomes evident. Moreover, 18.Ke2 leads to 18...Bd6 19.Rhc1 Rhb8! 20.Rc2 Be5, maintaining balance."
"After a brief opening shootout, the game has been transformed into an endgame with the isolani on d5. The true evaluation of this position determines how secure the entire plan with 5...Nc6 is, because modern theory considers this position the optimal achievement for white in this variation. The presence of the doubled pawns on the f-file is compensated by the possibility to attack the weak pawns d5 and a7 in black's position. Obviously, the key freeing maneuver for black is Ke7-e6 with the development of the bishop. But this takes time. The evaluation of this endgame depends upon how white can utilize this time. Jumping ahead a bit, I can say that I was able to make something out of my chances, although often black manages to hold this position.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the strategic implications of the move and the potential endgame situation that arose, suggesting a misjudgment in the sequence of moves or a lack of awareness of the long-term strategic consequences.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

The effectiveness of Black's plan with the move 5...Nc6 is now being questioned by modern theory, which suggests that this isn't the ideal outcome for Black in this particular variation. The weakness of the pawns on d5 and a7 can be exploited by White, despite the doubled pawns on the f-file. Moving the bishop to e6 is Black's main plan to free their position, but it requires time. White's success in this endgame will largely depend on Black's ability to hold the position."
"The queenside castling plan is considered most critical: 16.Be3 Ke6 17.0-0-0, and now white immediately hits the a7 and d5 pawns. But the open position of the king allows black to make his pieces cooperate well if he defends accurately. Here are several possibilities: 1) 17...Rc8+ 18.Kb1 Bc5 19.Rhe1 Kd6 20.Bf4+ Kc6 21.Re2 Rhd8; 16.Bf4 Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and black protects everything (J.Polgar-De Jong, Wijk aan Zee 1990), or 2) 17...Bb4 (stopping the check from e1) 18.Kb1 (or 18.a3 Rhc8+ 19.Kb1 Bc5) 18...Rhd8 19.Rd3 Rd7 20.Rc1 Rb8 21.Rc6+ Kf5 22.Ra6 (the pin 22.Rb3 is parried tactically: 22...d4! 23.Bd2 Bxd2 24.Rxb8 d3 25.Rc4 Bh6, and the passed pawn ties down white after d3-d2) 22...Rbb7 23.a3 Be7 - black transfers the bishop to f6, from where it controls the blockading square d4. This is an important factor in the defense of positions like this, with the isolated pawn. Black keeps the equal chances (Brunner-Adorjan, Germany 1990). If white tries 16.Bf4, in order to keep the black king from d6, the black king goes to f5 with tempo. For example, 16...Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and all is well for black (Brunner-Stering, Luxembourg 1989).",True,"

By advancing with 'Be3' and aiming to control the queenside, White missed the chance to solidify their position. This opened up the king, presenting 'Black' with ample room to coordinate their pieces effectively. 'Black' has several counterstrategies like 'Rc8+', 'Bc5', 'Kd6', 'Bf4+', 'Kc6', 'Re2', 'Rhd8', 'Bb4', 'Rac8+', 'Kb1', 'Ba5', 'Rhd8', 'Rc1', 'Rd7', 'Rc6+', 'Kf5', or 'Ra6' to maintain parity and effectively manage an isolated pawn. White's alternative such as 'Bf4' also allows 'Black' to gain tempo by moving the king to 'f5'. Clearly, White's kingside castle did not fortify their position as optimally as it could have.'"
"An important prophylaxis. If black manages to push his isolated pawn to d4, his difficulties will be behind him. For instance, 18.Be3 Be7 19.Rac1 Bf6 20.Rc5 Rhd8 21.b4 Ke6 22.b5 d4 and black's central counterplay compensates for white's flank activity.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to b7"," White played 26. Rc6+, which was a mistake as Black can respond with 25... Bd8. Then, with 26. Re5+ followed by 27. Rc6+, White would win."
"This is a very natural reaction to white's last move, as the king aims for the blockading d3 square. But perhaps, 27...h6 was a better defense, with g7-g5 to follow. In the game, the white rook utilizes the newly opened 4th rank, to undertake a bypass maneuver. The enemy, exhausted from the rook threats, agrees to exchange a pair of rooks, and this decreases the potential of the d3 pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential better defense offered by h6 and the consequences of the rook bypass maneuver.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

Black should have stoically continued with 29...Kc6.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake made by the black player by suggesting a better move, 29...Kc6, to improve their position.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

"Here also, 30...Kc6 was more active, keeping in store the defensive resource 31.Rxd8 Bxd8 32.Rd4 Rd7. Now, after the rook trade, a curious rook and bishop dance ensues, and it ends in the fall of the a7 pawn.",True,"

The comment explains that the move 30...Kc6 was a better option as it maintained more active defensive possibilities, leading to a complex but ultimately losing position for White after the rook trade.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

"The bishop ending is easily winning. Black should have kept his rook alive with 39...Rb5, aiming at the white kingside pawns.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that leaving the rook behind was a poor decision, as it allowed the opposing bishop to create a winning endgame.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.
