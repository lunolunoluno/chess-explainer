"Though a typical move in the Sicilian Defense, it proves to be very premature at this stage. This is because Black is expanding on the Queenside at the cost of the development of his pieces.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the early Queenside expansion which hinders the development of Black's pieces.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5", Black's move to b5 is rather unusual for the Sicilian Defense and isn't wise at this juncture. It's a Queenside expansion that sacrifices piece development.
With the threat of e4-e5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights a potential tactical opportunity by playing e4-e5, which would have put pressure on the opponent's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bf3,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f3", White's move to f3 was not ideal due to its potential for neglecting central control and opening lines for Black's pieces.
"Only move. If 8... Bb7,then 9. e5 9... Bf3 10. Qf3 dxe5 11. Nxe6 fxe6 12. Qxa8+- 9... dxe5 10. Bxb7 exd4 11. Nxb5 axb5 12. Bxa8 +-",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it outlines a sequence of moves leading to a tactical disadvantage or a loss of material for the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bf3 Ra7,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to a7"," The move in question was a passive and potentially risky one, as it allowed White to gain significant material advantage. After Black's Rook move to a7, White had a clear path to advance their position and materialize threats. By playing e5, White aimed to challenge Black's pawn structure and open lines for their pieces. Black's subsequent Bf3 move, while somewhat logical, did not address the immediate threats posed by White's central pawn push.

After White executed Qf3, Black's best defense was to capture the pawn with dxe5. However, White's move Qxa8+ was a blunder, as it did not result in a tangible advantage for White and allowed Black to safely recapture with the rook. This mistake gave Black an opportunity to seize material advantage, which continued with Black's move dxe5.

White's subsequent moves, Bxb7 and Nxb5, were also suboptimal and failed to secure material and positional advantages. Black's axb5 move effectively removed a central pawn, and White's Bxa8 move, although better than Qxa8+,"
Better than 9. Be3 as in that case Black could have played first...Rd7 followed by...Bb7. After the text move 9... Rd7 would be met by 10. e5 dxe5 11. Nc6 ! Qc7 12. Nxb8 Qxb8 13. Bc6 Qc7 14. Bxd7 Nxd7 with a clear advantage for White.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player by presenting a possible sequence of moves that would have led to a better outcome for Black, highlighting the potential downside of the move played.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bf3 Ra7 9. Qe2,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"," The move 9...Rd7 isn't the best choice. If Black plays Rd7, followed by Bb7, White can respond with 10. e5, forcing Black's pawn to capture on e5. Consequently, White can play 11. Nc6, bringing their knight to a powerful position on the board. Black's next move, Qc7, allows White to perform a tactical sequence with 12. Nxb8. This move captures Black's knight, giving White a significant material advantage. Black's last move, Qxb8, does not recover the lost material. Instead, White should continue with 14. Bxd7, where Black's only piece to capture, the knight, falls, leading to White's clear advantage."
Practically forced.,False,"

The comment ""Practically forced"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it implies that the move could have been a strategic choice, rather than a blunder.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bf3 Ra7 9. Qe2 Rc7 10. Rd1 Nbd7,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black).

Only move. If 11... b4 12. Na2! a5 13. Nb5 with an almost winning position.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it suggests that the move was not threatening and could have been avoided for a better position, leading to almost winning the game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O b5 8. Bf3 Ra7 9. Qe2 Rc7 10. Rd1 Nbd7 11. a4 bxa4,"This is a game between Smyslov, V (as White) and Kottnauer, C (as Black).

The comment accurately explains the mistake made in the move sequence by outlining the continuation after Be7, showing the consequences of the error in a sample variation.",1. e4 c5 2.

This guarantees White a great positional superiority. 13... dxe5 14. Bxb7 exd4 (14... Rxb7 15. Qxa6 clear plus for White.. Bxa6 Black faces great difficulties.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as the move Bxb7 allows Black to recapture with either the rook or a pawn, leading to a weakened pawn structure for White.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"," White's move of playing the pawn to e5 might seem to offer a strong positional advantage. However, Black's reply of 13... dxe5 followed by 14... exd4 could be problematic for White. If White captures the bishop with 15. Bxb7, Black might respond with 15... Rxb7. White can then take the rook with 16. Qxa6, which is a strong move. But if Black plays 15... Bxa6, they might face significant challenges in the ensuing game."

"Not a wee of a chance did Smyslov give to his opponent after 7)...b5 ?! . The most difficult thing in chess is to win a won position. Smyslov had a knack of finishing off his opponents at the hint of even a slight mistake. It is precisely this quality that made him a "" champion of champions"".",True,"

This comment explains the mistake made by Smyslov because it highlights his tendency to capitalize on opponents' mistakes, emphasizing his skill at ending games while his opponent is already in a compromised position.",1. e4 c5 2.
