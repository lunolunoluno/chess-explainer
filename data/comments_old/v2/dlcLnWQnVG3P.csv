Kramnik might find opportunities to use their knights more actively after this exchange."
"Kramnik mentioned that all the moves up to here were played by the program very quickly, meaning most of this is probably theory in the Fritz opening book. Here we should take stock. Fritz just played a good move (10. h4) securing his f4 knight by preventing the natural g5 advance by black. However, the f4 knight seems like white's only trump. The pawns on c3 an c4 are weak, black has the two knights in a closed position, and white's king is in the center while black's is in safety. However, the c4 pawn has the useful function of keeping the knight out of d5 while the c3 fellow solidifies d4. White has a solid position, but unless the bishops can be unleashed, black will have a slight advantage.",True,"

Last move played: White plays Pawn to h4"," Deep Fritz played a passive move (Pawn to h4), which seemed more like a theoretical choice from its opening book than a strong strategic decision. This move doesn't pose an immediate threat or challenge to Black's pieces, and it doesn't actively support White's position.

The White's knight on f4 could be a valuable piece, but its position on c4 seems compromised due to the pawns on c3 and c4 being somewhat weak. Black's knights are not actively engaged yet, and Black's king remains safe. White's king is central, but Black might have a slight edge if White's bishops aren't effectively deployed."
"Kramnik should leave e7 for the knight. I suggest 10...Qe8 or 10...Ne7. The Qe8-f7 maneuver is very useful as it eyes h5 and c4. 10...Ne7 allows black to play the prophylactic c5 to prevent the freeing c5 move for white. For instance 10...Ne7 11. h5 c5! 12. Ba3 Qa5 etc. and black has a ""very"" comfortable game though both Ng6 and Nh5 exchanging off f4 is prevented. Or if 10...Qe8!? 11. Ba3 Qf7 12. h5 b6 and if white plays the dubious 13. c5?! anyway, then 13...bxc5 14. dxc5 d5! and the black bishop is shut in and black has the superior center and now the e5 square.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7"," After considering the potential strategies, it's clear that Black's last move, placing the Queen on e7, is not optimal. A better approach could be to develop the Knight to e7 or Queen to e8. The maneuver of moving the Queen to e8 is advantageous as it targets key squares like h5 and c4. The alternative of moving the Knight to e7 also serves a preventative purpose for White by hindering the possibility of a c5 pawn push. For instance, after 10...Ne7, White might attempt to advance with 11. h5, but Black can solidify their position with 11...c5, leading to an improved and more comfortable game. If Black opts for 10...Qe8, they still maintain options like Qa5, but now White's knight on f3 could pose problems for Black's pawn structure. The move 13...bxc5 followed by 14. dxc5 d5 would give Black a strong grip on the center, but White's bishop on c1 remains passive."
"One might think 11. h5 to be enough to secure the knight at f4 and thus the game in general, but Fritz wants to trade off one of its weak pawns while trying to open the position for his two bishops. The a2-g8 diagonal is now open for the bishop or queen.",True,"

The sequence could lead to a decisive advantage for White, especially if Black opts for 13...cxd4?? and then 14. Ng6+ hxg6 15. hxg6+ Nh7 16. Rxh7 Checkmate. Alternatively, if Black plays 11...d5, White can simply proceed with 12. c4 to maintain the upper hand.

Another viable option was 11...Kh8, although the sacrificial play by White seems to be the most effective approach for countering the computer's lack of strategic depth."

"Wow. The first time I've ever seen Fritz decline a pawn. If Fritz doesn't see a mate in the line or decisive material advantage then he usually grabs material without second thought. However, here he didn't see decisive material advantage or mate and he DID declind the c7 pawn. Perhaps Fritz is starting to understand the position more with the new version?

It's a completely understandable mistake. Fritz is striving for bishop activity. 18. c6? can't be played because the a3 bishop would be hanging. Therefore Fritz logically defends it which allows him to play c6. Fritz is forgetting about his more important minor piece! The f4 knight.

Once the knight goes the kingside belongs to black and Kramnik will haven no trouble redirecting his forces.,True,"

This would have protected White's h4 pawn and allowed for a more favorable position. Black's best response was to move the king to h7, but White could have further improved their position with a rook move to b1, followed by pawn advances to c4 and d4, creating a significant advantage."

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as sacrificing the pawn on h4 leaves Black with the opportunity to trade off the bishop with Bf3, potentially leading to a significant advantage or even a winning position for Black.",1. c4 e5 2.

This comment suggests that the move in question, a natural sacrifice (sac), was not found by the computer's engine and thus indicates that it was likely a strategic mistake made by the player, assuming that the sacrifice was not leading to a beneficial position or gain.",1. c4 e5 2.
