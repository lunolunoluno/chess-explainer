?! - Unclear. The Bishop had to be developed first in e7. Now White has the possibility to take the advantage.,True,"

The comment appropriately explains the mistake by pointing out that the Bishop needs to be developed before other pieces can be effectively utilized, and it also mentions the potential advantage White has as a result of the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6,"This is a game between Pillsbury, Harry (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6", The move was suboptimal because the bishop had to be developed to e7 first. Now Black has the opportunity to gain an advantage.
!? - Possibility not exploited!,True,"

The comment indicates that the player made an incorrect move, and the mistake could have been taken advantage of, implying a missed opportunity to improve their position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qh4,"This is a game between Pillsbury, Harry (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h4"," ""!?"" - White's last move to h4 overlooked potential threats and strategic positioning."
"Attack, no waste of time.",False,"

The comment ""Attack, no waste of time"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as the comment focuses on the intention to attack rather than addressing the specific error in the previous move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qh4 Be7 8. O-O-O Qa5,"This is a game between Pillsbury, Harry (as White) and Lasker, Em (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a5",-
The unclear strategy of White has brought Black to possess a darksquared Bishop which shines now of his own light.,True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by White, suggesting a lack of a clear strategy that allowed Black to develop the darksquared Bishop advantageously.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qh4 Be7 8. O-O-O Qa5 9. e3 Bd7 10. Kb1 h6 11. cxd5 exd5 12. Nd4 O-O 13.

"White's attempt to organize a counterattack is touchy. If White tries to eliminate the danderous Bishop by profiting of the tactics 16.Ne4 then it would be enough 16...Be7 to keep or even enhance the pressure. If, instead, he chooses the more modest 16.Be2 then 16...Rac8 would have reinforced the attack. (Tartakower) 16...",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as White's move 16.Be2 is considered suboptimal compared to 16.Ne4, which would have been a more aggressive approach to eliminate the dangerous bishop.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Both the players are shooting their bullets. 17...,True,"

The comment implies that both players made mistakes, and the move in question (17...) was part of an error, suggesting it was the player's mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5.

Instinctive or calculated sacrifice? (Tartakower),True,"

The comment likely explains the mistake as it questions whether the move was made out of instinct or as part of a calculated sacrifice, which is relevant to evaluating the move's quality.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qh4 Be7 8. O-O-O Qa5 9. e3 Bd7 10. Kb1 h6 11. cxd5 exd5 12. Nd4 O-O 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14.

"!! - Very beautiful sacrifice! Now the ""b"" column will be half opened and the long diagonal seized (almost) by the Bishop in f6 will be transformed in a loooong and very dangerous springboard.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it praises the move as a beautiful sacrifice without addressing any issues or errors.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5.

The comment seems to analyze a potential strategic decision rather than evaluating a specific mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5 5. Bg5 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qh4 Be7 8.

The comment implies that the player made a move that compromised the position of their own King, which is a common chess mistake as it can lead to loss of material or checkmate.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

The comment ""! - Untouchable."" implies that the move played is considered a blunder, as it leaves the opponent's king in a vulnerable position without any prospects for defense or counterplay.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.
