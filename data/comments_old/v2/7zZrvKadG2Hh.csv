"(Designed to prevent the ...g5 break so common in the 08/g3 main lines, or so I read from my books!)",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it suggests that the player's move was intended to prevent a specific line of play (the g5 break in the 08/g3 main lines), indicating a misjudgment in their strategy or knowledge of the game.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h4"," The move was made to inhibit Black's...g5 strategy, which is typical in the 08/g3 lines."
(Against Paul McDonald in Section 'A' Alan played the alternative 11...Be7.),True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it identifies a specific alternative move (11...Be7) that could have been played instead of the move that was actually played, implying that the move played was a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e5"," 'Alan made an inferior move with 11...Be7 against Paul McDonald in Section 'A' by settling for a passive defense, missing an aggressive opportunity.'"
# (The line that I was following continued,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests that the player was following a specific line or strategy during the game, and their move deviated from that plan.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"," '# (The continuation of the line led to a suboptimal position from Black's perspective, as it allowed White further control over the center and prepared for an aggressive stance.)'"
"(Also planning to sacrifice on e5, but to recapture with the queen after d4xe5, but...)",True,". The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating a poorly thought-out sacrifice and a questionable recapture strategy.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c7"," ""Black's last move was a poor choice as they planned to sacrifice on e5, but the intent was to recapture with the queen after d4xe5. However, this approach is flawed as it exposes their queen unnecessarily."""
"(Pinning the ...Nc6 to the ...Qc7, and also threatening 17.Bxh7+, thus effectively, if Black played 16...Ndxe5 although he is still disolving the White centre, he will have a 2 pawn defecite, not just 1!)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the pinning of Black's knight to the queen, and the potential double pawn weakness, which would put significant pressure on Black's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2"," Black's move is disadvantageous because it exposes the queen to potential threats and compromises their pawn structure. By moving the queen to c2, Black creates potential weaknesses that White can exploit, such as threats of a check with the bishop on h7. This move may force Black to make aggressive moves without compensating for the loss of material, specifically a pawn in two separate instances."
"(""Chickening out"" of liquidating the centre under my terms.)",True,"

The comment highlights a strategic error by suggesting the player should have prioritized securing central control over other considerations.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"," ""This move by Black doesn't improve their position or challenge White's control of the center."""
(Now the Nf3 is no longer pinned to the White King. the exchange sacrifice on e5 is now impossible.),True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the mistake involves a loss of the pinning situation and the inability to execute the planned exchange sacrifice.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17.

Last move played: White plays King to g3"," ""The Nf3 was no longer pinned to the White King, making the exchange sacrifice on e5 a non-viable option."""
"(A weakening move, trying to connect his Rooks with a subsequent ...Bb7, but this Bishop's power is blunted by it's own prawns!)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the potential weakening of their position due to the move, which may hinder the rook's connection and activity.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"," White initiated a pawn move to b5, which is aiming to connect the Rooks with a potential...Bb7. However, this move underutilizes the Bishop's potential, as it becomes somewhat restricted by its own pawns."
"#(I origionally intended playing 23.Qxg6 with what I thought was a winning plan involving 24.Ng5, but 23...Rf8! 24.Ng5 Rf6! exploiting the prawn's enpinment on the White king, rathet scuppers my plans.)",True,"

The comment clearly explains the mistake made by the player, detailing the intended move and the counter-play that led to the loss of the advantage.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17. Kg3 b5 18. Nh3 Rd8 19. Rac1 Bb7 20.

Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on g6"," Incorrect move 23.Qxg6 because Black responds with Rf8, and then White's Ng5 is met with Rf6, exploiting White's own king's position."
(Resigns 0 1!! Not bad for my first shot at the White side of the French Tarrach eh? My annalysis now runs),True,"

The comment suggests that the player resigned after realizing their move was mistaken, acknowledging it as their first attempt to play as White in the French Tarrach, and indicating that they will analyze their decision further.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17. Kg3 b5 18. Nh3 Rd8 19. Rac1 Bb7 20.

Last move played: White plays Queen to d2", They (White) resigned immediately after playing Qd2. Their analysis indicated that this was not a strong opening move in the French Defense.
(Intending 29.Nxf8 with mate imminent... If,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player as it suggests the player's intention to execute a checkmate with 29.Nxf8, indicating that there was a tactical error in not achieving this immediate threat.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17. Kg3 b5 18. Nh3 Rd8 19. Rac1 Bb7 20.

Last move played: White plays Queen to f4"," (White plays Nxf8, but this move is incorrectâ€”it doesn't lead to immediate checkmate. The piece to target might be Bishop on C4.)"
(and Black has to sacrifice even more material to survive in the short term.),True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential consequences of their move, indicating a loss of material for Black if they continue to play in the same manner.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 Qb6 8. h4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 f6 11. Be3 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O 13. a3 Be7 14. b4 a6 15. Bd3 Qc7 16. Qc2 h6 17. Kg3 b5 18. Nh3 Rd8 19. Rac1 Bb7 20.

Qxe5,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Armstrong, Alan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on e5", White's last move to capture on e5 was a risky decision that could lead to Black having to give up more material to maintain the position.
