Now we have a reversed Sicilian 2.c3 where White has the extra move 2.g3 I've long held the view that 2...Nf6 is Black's best against 2.c3 so maybe I should have played 3.Nf3here,True,"

Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," In response to the current board, White has played 2.g3, a variation of the Sicilian Defense aiming for a reversed setup. While this move can be played, it's typically not Black's best response against a typical 2.c3, which aims for a Maroczy Bind structure. A more solid choice for Black at this juncture might have been 2...Nf6, solidifying control over the central squares and preparing for a robust b5 advance to break the center and challenge White's setup."

Now we have a position similar to that in Tarrasch Defence where Black's easy development and active pieces compensate for the supposedly weakpawnatd5,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the trade-off between having a weak pawn at d5 and the advantage of better development and active pieces, which is characteristic of the Tarrasch Defence.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 c6 3. d4 exd4 4.
