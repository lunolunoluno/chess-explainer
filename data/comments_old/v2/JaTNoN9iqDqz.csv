"Fischer plays simply. Alternatively, after 8.Nd2 Nf6 9.Qe2, White plays for the attack, but Black has queenside and central chances.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake, as it suggests that Fischer missed a tactical opportunity to launch an attack on the kingside while still maintaining options for queenside and central play.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"," White's move with the Queen to e2 was a passive strategy that didn't capitalize on the initiative. Black, controlling the queenside and central squares, has more aggressive play options available."
"Petrosian probably didn't like 10...Nxd5 because of 11.Be4 and now 11...Bb7 12.Qb3 is unpleasant, intending Rf1-d1 and Nb1-c3, while 12.Nc3 is also possible. { Petrosian thought 10...Qxd5 was best, but after 11.Nc3, White is two tempos ahead and should be able to exploit this.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential disadvantages of Black's move 10...Nxd5 and suggesting better alternatives.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d5"," Petrosian probably didn't like 10...Nxd5 because White has strong follow-up moves. After 11.Be4, Black's position becomes difficult, as White can play 11...Bb7, preparing 12.Qb3, which targets the weak d5 square and aims for a dangerous Rf1-d1 and Nb1-c3 setup. Petrosian might have considered 10...Qxd5 to be the best, but after 11.Nc3, White gains a tempo advantage and can capitalize on it, putting pressure on Black's position."
This is a very unpleasant check.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it suggests the player's move has resulted in a check, potentially leaving the player's king in a vulnerable position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black).

"After 12...Bd7 13.Qc2, White has some pressure, but after 13...0-0 14.Bg5 h6 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nxd5, chessplayers these days would not be so afraid of having this position with Black - Black has the bishop pair, but Fischer knew Petrosian didn't like to sacrifice pawns, so he believed Petrosian wouldn't even consider this line.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that the player missed the opportunity to create dynamic counterplay and pressure after sacrificing the pawn on f6, which could have potentially led to a better position for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black).

However, the subsequent moves 13...0-0 14.Bg5 h6 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nxd5 didn't pose a threat Petrosian couldn't handle. Black maintains an advantage with the bishop pair, an element not to be underestimated. Nevertheless, Fischer anticipated Petrosian's propensity for not playing for free pawns, deeming the position less perilous than it might seem."
"Very simple - pinning the bishop on e7. If 13.Bb5 axb5 14.Qxa8 0-0, when Black can continue with Bc8-b7, and d5-d4, when Black is better developed with a strong passed d-pawn, and the White queen is out of play.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it identifies the pinning of the bishop on e7 and outlines the consequences for White, including the potential for Black to gain a significant advantage through development and pawn structure.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13.

Black can capitalize on this by moving the bishop to b7, which would put pressure on the White queen. Additionally, Black could play d5-d4, creating a strong passed pawn that could become a threat in the mid-game. The White queen is now less active and out of play."
"If 13...d4 14.Nb5 0-0 15.Qxd4 axb5 16.Qxd7 Bxd7 17.Rxe7, or 13...0-0? 14.Qxd7 Bxd7 15.Rxe7 and White is winning.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that after the move 13...d4, White has a winning position with the moves 14.Nb5, 0-0, 15.Qxd4, axb5, 16.Qxd7, Bxd7, 17.Rxe7.",1. e4 c5 2.

After White plays 13...d4, the move 14.Nb5 offers White a strong positional advantage. If Black chooses to capture on d4 with the queen (13...Qxd4), White can take back with the queen and launch a powerful attack. The move 14.Qxd4 followed by Black's 15...axb5 allows White to continue the attack with 16.Qxd7, putting pressure on Black's position. If Black responds with 14...0-0, White still retains the initiative with 15.Qxd7 Bxd7 16.Rxe7, maintaining a winning position."
The position is almost equal but Fischer shows good technique in this position.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it instead acknowledges the quality of Fischer's technique in the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5.

"If 15...Nd7 16.f4 g6 17.Rac1 0-0 18.Bd4, intending 19.f5 gxf5 20.Bxf5 Bxf5 21.Rxe7, etc.",True,"

The comment adequately explains the mistake made by the player as it identifies the strategic error in the move sequence, suggesting a more aggressive continuation for White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15.

Fixing the a-pawn and preparing Na4-c5.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the need to fix the a-pawn and preparing for a future move, Na4-c5, indicating a potential weakness or an opportunity in the opponent's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Taking the e4- and g4-squares away from the Black knight.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the move taken by the player removed the ability of the Black knight to control the e4 and g4 squares, potentially weakening the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"," The comment could be rephrased as: ""Taking away the e4 and g4 squares from the knight is not a good move by Black."""
Intending Bd7-b5.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the attempted mistake of the player by planning to move the bishop from d7 to b5, which could be a strategic error depending on the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Fischer loved the R + B vs R + N endings.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it only provides information about a type of endgame (R + B vs R + N) that the player might have a preference for, rather than addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

The comment accurately explains the strategic implications of the mistake made by White, highlighting the potential gain of an extra pawn and the likely outcome in favor of White in various continuations.",1. e4 c5 2.
