"Black prepares ...Nc5 by for the moment preventing b2-b4. White, in turn, is ready to evict the knight from c5 by Ne1-d3, or to exchange it. Of course, I could have exchanged on d4 earlier, but when the white bishop is developed at e2 I do not like to take on d4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the possibility of exchanging on d4 earlier, which could have prevented the positional issue caused by the knight on c5.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d5 a5,"This is a game between Lisitsyn, G (as White) and Bronstein, D (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a5"," Black played Pawn to a5, which doesn't contribute significantly to the game. It temporarily stops White's plan of pushing the knight to c5 and taking control of the board. White has options to challenge Black's knight, either by moving it to d3 or considering a trade. Although exchanging on d4 could have been beneficial earlier, the presence of the white bishop on e2 makes taking on d4 less appealing."
"It used to be thought that, when Black's knight reached c5, he achieved a good position. After all, I was not the first and not the tenth person to play the King's Indian. It was employed by Capablanca and the English Champion Yates, and it was played by Reti, Euwe, Chigorin and even Tarrasch. But it should be realised that this is a good position only compared with the Queen's Gambit, where you are down on your knees, awaiting the invasion of a knight at e5, the doubling of rooks, and so on.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by comparing the current position with a superior alternative (Queen's Gambit), highlighting the inferiority of the present move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d5 a5 9. Ne1 Nc5,"This is a game between Lisitsyn, G (as White) and Bronstein, D (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c5"," Lisitsyn, as White, made an aggressive move. Although Black's knight reaching c5 is traditionally seen as strong, it's crucial to consider the current position and potential weaknesses. This move may not be optimal, as it can lead to vulnerabilities such as a knight invasion at e5 or rook doubling, which could pressure Black significantly."
"Georgy Lisitsyn was a very strong player, who wrote three excellent books - on the opening, middlegame, and endgame. I confidently played 12...Ng4, and was very surprised by the exchange of first one bishop for a knight, and then the other.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it acknowledges the loss of material and the surprising nature of the exchange, which likely led to a disadvantageous position for the player.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d5 a5 9. Ne1 Nc5 10. Qc2 b6 11. Bg5 h6 12. Be3 Ng4,"This is a game between Lisitsyn, G (as White) and Bronstein, D (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to g4"," Black made a surprising move with 12...Ng4, exchanging a bishop for a knight and then another bishop."
"Today, of course, I would have taken the knight at d3 and then played ...Bd7.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the player missed an opportunity to capture an important piece and improve their position after the move d3.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d5 a5 9. Ne1 Nc5 10. Qc2 b6 11. Bg5 h6 12. Be3 Ng4 13. Bxg4 Bxg4 14. Nd3 Bd7,"This is a game between Lisitsyn, G (as White) and Bronstein, D (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d7"," In today's game, White would have likely considered taking the knight on d3, but that move didn't quite align with their strategy. Instead, Black played the Bishop to d7, which was not the optimal move."
"A brilliant decision by White - he captured with his bishop (!) on c5 and then played f2-f4. I found myself in a very difficult position, and did not know what to do. In general, at that time I was not afraid of ending up in difficulties, as I always believed I would find something! That was also the case in the present game.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it defends the decision rather than acknowledging it as a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7.

The only way to gain some play.,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player as it lacks specific details about the mistake or the board position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7.

"We were both in severe time trouble, with about a minute each for our last fifteen moves. At the time I was very proud of this move.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake because it highlights the influence of severe time trouble on the player's decision-making, causing them to feel proud of a move that might not have been the strongest considering the circumstances.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 e5 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d5 a5 9. Ne1 Nc5 10. Qc2 b6 11. Bg5 h6 12. Be3 Ng4 13. Bxg4 Bxg4 14. Nd3 Bd7 15. Rae1 f5 16. Bxc5 bxc5 17. f4 exf4 18.
