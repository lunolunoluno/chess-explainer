are plausible causes for both players to deviate. The black strategie, to slow
the development of the king's side while seizing a capable hedgehog-formation

handles with two principle plans for white: first, to fight the cautious black
manouvers simply with pieces in the center - that means Re1, eventually Bg5

to open files on the queenside, since black moved the b-pawn only to b6
instead of b5!   Second, to start a fierce pawn-attack on the kingside. In the
game white manages to combine this different strategic aims in a remarkable
way:",False
