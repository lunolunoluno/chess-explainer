aggressive openings up until they are over the 1500 mark. From 1500 - 1800
they learn the Colle - K. It/^s good for handling better opponents with
explosive possibilities. After 1800 I require them to play the Torre and
introduce them to the Queen/^s Gambit. The Colle introduces the player to
games that are (+)close[+] (less given to the luck that the opponent will miss
something). In other words, creating advantages from equal positions. Also it
stretches them to understand the position and play accordingly.",False

is more or less a matter of time. These are excellent training positions. Now
how will White cash in on his dominance? Nbd4 Ouch. Between the next four
moves you demonstrate that you do not understand the position. Consider Be3
with the idea of Bc5. Also consider Qg3 with the idea of Bxh6. When you are up
positionally, look for ways to tie the opponent/^s position down more. Look
for the most forcing moves. The two redeeming factors are that Black is
uncoordinated and White has both Bishops controlling the Kingside. Nxc6 Bxc6
Be3 Rc8 Qh4 You completely miss the point of the position. You must learn to
read the position! You have complete dominance on the Kingside thanks to your
Bishops. You have complete control of the dark squares thanks to Black/^s lack
of dark square Bishop. You are playing a virtual piece up thanks to the bad
Black Bishop. You have a fine out post for the Knight on d4. How can you take
advantage of these ideas? First you can try 24. Bb6 Qc7 25. Nd5. Now you can
consider Nxe6 prying open the middle and giving you a passed pawn. With the
two active Bishops White should finish Black off quickly. This is one of those
double-edged moves. I like it because it sets up an interesting defense but
Black mishandles it and never uses the idea.",True

The idea of /\Be8 was to play /\Bg6, which looks like it stabilizes the
position - for now. Bd4 When in control, keep it patient and simple. When
behind the defense must be patient but also active. Many times, the defense
wants to complicate a position in hopes that he opponent will lose the way. An
idea that would be very difficult to risk in OTB play would be 26. Bxf4. In
postal, I would have given it a try. The trade is to give Black the White
Queenside in exchange for an attack on the Black Kingside. This will work if
you get the King (which might prove difficult). However if you don/^t get the
King, you have given Black a huge end game advantage. Always play with an eye
on the endgame. At this point, I like your choice.",True

didn/^t he take the pawn?[+] White misses the (+)crush[+] 29.Qxe6. Through out
this game you have made life interesting for Black then let him off the hook
due to not understanding the position. It is true that at this point anything
short of divine intervention will probably not help Black. However, you must
catch these opportunities if you want to move to a higher level. Against a
seasoned opponent the outcome of this game would have been different. Rg1  Rf8
b4  Rg8 Interesting. 31/\ h4 prolongs the agony. gxh6 gxh6 Suggestions #1:
Work on your positional understanding. A big area to focus on would be
superior minor pieces. In this game you never made use of your Bishops - they
tended to be glorified pawns. They are key in the Colle - K. If you don/^t use
them, you need another opening! Suggestion #2: Consider a more flexible
opening such as the Torre or Colle - Zukertort. (+)Forcing[+] openings tend to
be (+)one idea[+] openings. One of the dangers of (+) forcing[+] openings is
the guys that write the books make us think that all we have to do is
understand the ideas behind the openings. Unfortunately the idea may be
completely misguided in a given concrete situation. Where ideas come to force
is in flexible openings where you can often put two or more ideas together to
create complicated patterns of pressure. In this game you were patient which
should serve you well if this is your general tendency. Suggestion #3: Lost
games are more valuable than won games for learning (analyzing a won game is
not as useful). Compile a file of lost games (50 or more) and examine them for
common errors. This will include where the error was made (keep a close look
out for transitions). When you see a (+)losing[+] move try to figure out the
circumstances that brought you to this place. Some losing moves are a result
of a series of bad ideas or a lack of understanding the position. You can
frame your wins. Suggestion #4: Force yourself to calculate one more move.
Play based on concrete positions, not general ideas (use them only to get
ideas, after that, calculate, calculate, calculate). When it seemed that you
started to do this you played much better. It will also help you to take
bigger risks. Qxg8++",True
