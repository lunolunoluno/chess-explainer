players have followed strictly the main line of the variation. Black is the
first to deviate in a less practised continuation. Here usually 11. ... Nd4 is
played. I found the variants there too sharp and insecure to my taste so I
chose the move in the game which seemed a bit ""calmer"".",True

White is obliged here to sharpen the game by means of 16.d4, although this is
pretty risky too, e. g.:",True

tarted with this move wasn't all clear to me at that very moment. I somehow
felt I must be pushing on the queen side and in the center but did not yet see
any exact goals. I was lucky to find a relatively straightforward way to win
anyway. Now for the plan: black tries to occupy d4 with a piece (preferably
knight) and to take the control over the opened c-file. At the same time the
weak a4-pawn is constantly being threatened so white is kept busy. Black does
not avoid exchanges since even with relatively few peaces the control of the
opened line and the penetration with the rook on the seventh rank bring easily
serious advantages.",True
