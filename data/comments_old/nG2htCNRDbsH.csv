1. e4,Kasparov has also played 1. d4 against Ivanchuk.,False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6,"I don't recall Ivanchuk previously using this system against Kasparov. His flexibility with openings is shared by some other GMs, but few people truly play many defenses (or openings for White) with equal skill. There is simply too much specialized detail about most openings for this to be possible. Ivanchuk does better than most, but still has an occasional flub, as in the first round game of his FIDE wch match with Ponomariov.",False

He's traded off one minor piece, so his cramp won't be too terrible, but he will have to be in a mood to counter-attack if he's to find any chance to win.",True

O-O Rb8,"Usually one wouldn't consider moving Pb7 when there's a Be2 to target Pa6, but Black has to be able to play ...b7-b6 to prevent c4-c5 and possibly to play ...b7-b5 (or ...b6-b5) to chop into White's central pawns, making more room for Black pieces to maneuver. Naturally White will make this more difficult.",False

Rfd1 Rfc8,"preventing Bb6-c7xd6 and targeting Pc4. Kasparov isn't gaining much ground and without queens he won't have any king-side attack. Still, Black has no particular advantage (s) .",False

Be3 Nd7 19. Na4 Rc6 20. f3 Kf8,"If White hadn't played Nc3-a4 Black's Nd7 could go to e5, but in this situation Na4-b6 hits Ra8 and guards Pc4. So, Black just keeps playing good position-improving moves.",True

One obvious offensive idea is to double rooks on the d-file to threaten Pd6, but that's met by ...g7-g5 to chase Bf4 back. I suppose Kasparov just decided it wasn't worth the risk to try any major offensive thrust; so, he'll just wait for the next game and see what develops.",True
