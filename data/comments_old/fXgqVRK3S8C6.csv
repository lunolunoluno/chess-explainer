1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4,"Lilienthal opens in classical fashion, and Capablanca shows his flexibility by adopting the NimzoIndian Defense -- a fashionable new continuation at the time that shocked some of the classically-minded theoreticians.
The NimzoIndian is a formidably complex opening with many fascinating byways, but the ideas at the outset are not too difficult to understand. White, by playing 3.Nc3, threatens to play 4.e4. Even the ""hypermodernists"" realized that giving White this much leeway in the center was a recipe for trouble, so Black must find a way to deter White from occupying that square. The standard method, before Nimzowitsch began to spread his heresy, was 3...d5, transposing into a Queen's Gambit Declined. This effectively stops 4.e4 by putting additional guards on that key square. The Nimzoindian, by contrast, stops e4 by depriving the pawn of support -- the pinned N/c3 is no longer rendering active service.
White has a wide range of responses. 4.Qc2, one of the earliest moves to gain favor, has recently come back into vogue. During the 1970's, it was difficult to find any master who would play anything but 4.e3. Romanishin experimented with 4.g3 in the 1980's. But Lilienthal was fond of a blunt approach championed by Saemisch.",False
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3,"Putting the question to the Bishop. Since Black frequently exchanges on c3 of his own free will, this can seem like a loss of time. But matters are not so simple. For the tempo spent forcing Black to make his choice, White gets a clarified central position in which he knows, to some extent, what Black's options are. The theoretical battle is still going on, though it's not quite so hot as it once was.
Saemisch's 4.a3 remains a viable approach to the position for those who know it well. Lilienthal knows it very well indeed.",True

Capablanca abandons the struggle over e4 here in order to take a simplifying line in which his Bishop will be exchanged for White's B/f1. The little flurry of tactics that now arises is easily foreseen by master players, but it's worth noting since it is a recurring theme in many d-pawn openings.",False

The answer lies, as it usually does for any really difficult combination, in multiple factors: the opening of the e-file, the presence of the B/h4, and the arrival of a pawn at g7 which will simultaneously strike at h8 and take away a flight square at f8.
Black has little choice now but to accept the Queen sacrifice. Trying to take the B/h4 instead fails, because of the most common of all tactical motifs, an undefended piece -- in this case, the R/c8. Thus: if 20...Qxh4 21.fxg7 Rg8 22.f6! and now 22...Nxf6 fails to 23.Qf5! forking f6 and c8 while pinning the hapless N/f6 against the f7 pawn.",True
