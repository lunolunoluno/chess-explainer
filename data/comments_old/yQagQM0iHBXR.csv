1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6,Adams use of Petrov's Defense against Kasparov didn't fare too well. I wonder why he's repeating it here.,True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7,"This is perhaps the most popular move at this point. It prepares ...O-O and blocks the e-file, but isn't very aggressively placed.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. c4,Since Black hasn't put any pressure on Nf3 or Pd4 White feels free to threaten Pd5 & Ne4. This adds more weight to White's offense before Nb1-c3.,True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. c4 Nb4 9. Be2 O-O 10. Nc3 Bf5 11. a3 Nxc3 12. bxc3 Nc6,and even after this knight has retreated Black uses Bf5 to challenge for control of the most useful diagonal b1-h7,True

Re1,"I don't see that this move makes much sense until he's prepared another place for Be2. As things stand Be2 can hardly move, so Re1 is pretty well blocked.",True

Ra2 b6 19. h3 Na5 20. g4 Bg6 21. g5 Be7 22. Ne5 Bd6 23. Nxg6 hxg6 24. c5 Bf8 25. Bg4 Rcd8 26. Rae2 Qc6,The preceding moves with no notes should not be taken as perfect or needing no commentary. It's just they are the same moves as Kasparov-Adams from round 5. It's curious that Adams lost that game and yet drew this one with only one new move. That's quite a feat.,False
