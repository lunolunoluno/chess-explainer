1. h4 Nf6,"Good. You get
your knight into the game, and help control the center. When getting your
pieces out, develop toward the center (the squares e4, d4, e5, d5 are known as
the center).",True
1. h4 Nf6 2. Rh3,"?! Extremely dubious. The rook is vulnerable to attack,
this move does not control the center, and this weakens white's kingside. Pawn
to d4 makes more sense.",True
1. h4 Nf6 2. Rh3 h5,"Much stronger is 2 ... d5. This gets a foothold
in the center, opens up a line for your bishop on c8, and to boot forces white
to move one of his pieces again, since the Rook on h3 is threatened by black's
bishop. Notice too, that now the g5 square is open for white's pieces, since
now your h-pawn can't cover it.",True
1. h4 Nf6 2. Rh3 h5 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5+ c6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Qd6,"Since a rook is worth more than a bishop (rook = 5 pawns, bishop = 3 pawns),
better is to take the free material with ...Bxh3. Believe it or not, among
masters, the difference of having a rook instead of a bishop is winning.",False

If you see a good move, stop: there might be an even better move.",True

remember is: why did my opponent make that move? You probably would've seen
that he was threatening your bishop.",True

iple in chess that says, ""Avoid moving queens early"". This is no exception. In
addition, White's knight was threatening to capture black's rook. Why not win
a pawn and get your rook out of jeapardy with ...Rxg2?",True

Knight, and once white's rook moves, even ...Nxf2 is in the air.",True

As it happens, black can win a knight by playing 16. ... Rg1+ 17. Ke2 (forced)
