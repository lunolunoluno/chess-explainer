1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 Nf6,"By playing 4...Nf6, Wollner avoids some of the terrifying tactics of the Danish proper. At the time, this was considered a fully viable mode of defense. 
Wollner, perhaps understandably, was reluctant to grab that final pawn. Today, theory claims that Black can wend his way to equality by giving back the material in a tactical counter-trick, as follows: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5 The first pawn is given back. 6.Bxd5 Nf6 7.Bxf7+ And now, the second. But hasn't Black gone too far -- isn't he dropping his Queen here? 
7...Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ The counter-trap: Black regains his material. 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2.
""Theory"" judges this position to be equal. That may be true, but it's worth pointing out that the position is also very sharp, with substantial pawn majorities for each side. Some correspondence players have recently resurrected this variation as a winning attempt for White. It demands accurate defensive play from Black, because White's pawns advancing on the Kingside ""bite"" faster, thanks to Black's exposed Knight and King.
In this side line, there's one other move also worth considering. When Black plays ... Nf6, White need not liquidate but can instead play for central domination by accenting his development: 7.Nc3 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 One of the many interesting points in this line is that Black cannot force an exchange of Queens here, thanks to a very clever tactical shot: 8...c6 ... apparently forcing the Knight to move, but -- 9.Nf6+ White pulls Black's pieces forcibly into a fork! 9...gxf6 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxf6+ ... and when the dust clears, White is the exchange ahead. That is the tactical rationale behind White's interesting winning attempt with Nc3. I have much more analysis of this in my secret notebooks!",True

The most natural move here would be the simple and obvious Bg5, pinning the Knight and threatening Nd5 to disrupt the Kingside pawn formation. Black, however, could meet the pin with Nbd7, since he has not committed his N/b8 to c6 yet. Charousek therefore tries something which might, in the final analysis, be labeled a ""coffeehouse"" move. But if so, then coffeehouse chess is superb!",True

We know that Nxf7 is, on general principles, a poor move -- trading two active minor pieces for a R + P is a bad deal in the opening and middlegame. Impatiently, Wollner tries to brush the Knight aside like Goliath trying to brush that pesky shepherd lad out of the way...",True

Charousek has no intention of giving up his perfectly good Bishop for the Rook on f7. Instead, he has spied a fascinating feature of the position. We saw that by delaying the development of his Queen's Knight, Black has reserved the possibility of Nbd7 defending f6. But Charousek has seen -- and brilliantly exposes -- the dark side of Black's delayed development. The following combination is made possible because Black's Queen is undefended!",True

Charousek is not simply attacking the Rook: he has also used the P/e6 to cut off the defense of Black's Knight on the light diagonal from c8 to g4. In a sense, this is a very sophisticated double attack. Wollner is no fool: he realizes his position is desperate. So he immediately plays for the counterattack.",True

Years later, Kester Svendsen wrote a wonderful short story entitled ""Last Round,"" about an old master who has tried for 50 years to create a work of art, the perfect game. In the crucial final round of a World Championship tournament, he trails the mighty Russian Rolavsky by half a point, and they are paired. Svendsen weaves his story around this as their game.
