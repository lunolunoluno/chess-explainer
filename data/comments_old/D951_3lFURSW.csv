opponent have played ""book"" moves. In other words these moves are already

maze this deep into the game. You need to be wary of being lead to the
slaughter. Never take on an opponent in their territory. You can avoid the
Petroff/Russian Defense with 3. Nc3. This will get you back into lines you
probably know and positions where you are comfortable. At the very least, you
take your opponent out of his specialty.",False

either gets their head handed to them or they have a brilliant idea. In this
case, you get your head. You have many problems -> the open d - file, the half
open f - file, the non-development of the Queenside pieces, Black's control of
the middle, weak King position. (All tactics are based on positional elements.)
Somehow you must buy some time to develop your pieces. Not to question theory,
but you should go back and understand how this line has led you to a miserable
position. BTW, this looks like one of those moves a computer would make.",True

square(s) that the Bishop uses to attack the same side of the board that it
sits on. Often we see a Bishop cutting across a diagonal but the real danger
comes from these pivot points where suddenly it is attacking back across the
grain. This move is brought to you courtesy of your lack of development.",True

the back row checkmate. Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a
tactical shot. c3 Ouch, this is probably the only move that looses. You should
have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development
on you, you can not afford the time to chase pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing
to move the Bishop of the ""dangerous diagonal"" (the diagonal that bears down
on your f2/f7 square). You are completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2:
Development is more important than breathing! Chess in a sense is a war game
where you must mobilize your troops. If you do not, you insure an easy game
for your opponent. Again, this is another computer like mistake. Play more
live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on
the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open
files. The one that is going to seal your fate is the d - file. (Chess lesson
#4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent puts together two common
patterns. Bxe4 Pattern #1: The decoy. This decoy had the added bite of
actually creating extra possibilities on f2. Pattern #2: Clearing the file.
Both of these are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time on
learning these basic patterns. Qxf2",True

Imbalances. An imbalance is any difference in the position. At this point you
are 2 Bishops & Rook verses Queen and Pawn. Not bad as far as material is
concerned. However, look at how the Knight dominates both your Bishops and
Rook. This is called the ""superior minor piece."" In spite of your material
differences, you are playing a virtual Rook, Knight, and Bishop down (pieces
that have not been developed). Black also has his pick of the d - file, the f

not possible - the Bishop can not move though the Queen on f4. Thus I'm
assuming the correct move was 28/\Qh4. Chess lesson #6: Pins. Somewhere I read/
heard that 80% of Master level games are decided by a pin. In this case the
pin is ""absolute."" In other words you can not move the pinned piece. (A
""relative"" pin is when you can move the pinned piece - at the cost of what's
behind it.) You must deal with a pin immediately if not sooner! There are
three ways to do this: move the piece that is behind the pin, attack the
pinning piece, and impose another piece in-between. For instance, look at the
common ""relative"" pin of a Black Bishop on g4, White Knight on f3 and Queen on
d1. You can move the Queen, ""question the Bishop"" with h3 (which generally
leads to an exchange), or play Be2 (freeing the Knight and the Queen). Bc4+

win if you resign. You have a combination of interesting ideas available to
you. First, your opponent is crushing you like a bug - you have him just where
you want him. Second, you have two Bishops on a very open board and a Rook
sitting on an open file. The conditions are ripe for a major league swindle.
Possible over-confidence or carelessness can sometimes be used to steal a
point. Try 35. Rd7+, if Black carelessly moves 35/\Kc8 you force mate. If 35.
Rd7+ Kb8 36. Bd6 again tempting /\Kc8 forcing mate (37. Bc7+ Kd8 38. Rc8#).
Develop a reputation for being dangerous when you are cornered. If chess is a
war, it is not an honorable one. You must try every filthy, disgusting, ugly,
swindle opportunity the board position gives you. Just be a gentleman and
don't gloat, laugh or put down your opponent. There is a difference gritty
chess and bad sportsmanship. exf3 resign",True
