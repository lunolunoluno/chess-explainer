attempt an ""instant"" endgame where White's pawn structure is superior. Also it
stops /\Qd6 which is a natural freeing move and gives you plenty of
opportunity to lose material. You avoid these pitfalls. A stronger
consideration in this position would be the move 14/\Bxf3. After 15. Qxf3 Ne5

the Knight. In the endgame with pawns on both sides, the Bishop is favored.

many possibilities. Take some time to ponder this point. Ouch again. Try 24/
\Rb6. The Knight without a target is only taking up space. I know the
proverbial idea of taking away the Knight's advance points but in this case it
opens the door for White to gain a comfortable position. When you have
positional justification - ATTACK! The move /\g6 can be played later. The idea
is to inspire those Queenside pawns to move and weaken themselves before your
opponent can fix the a-pawn and pick it off. Rad1 O.K. Your GM returns the
favor. 25. Rae1 grabs space and almost wins the endgame by force. You might
benefit by the study of isolated pawn play. The isolated pawn is safely
blocked. Controlling the e-file would cut off the support of the King. The
fatal attack on the blocked pawn must come either from behind or beside the
pawn. This can't be achieved with the Rook on d1. It's unbelievable that a GM
would miss this move. You get time to set up an adequate defense. Nice! This
is about the only chance you have to protect your weakness. White should now
shift the attention to immobilizing the a-pawn and finding a way to pile up
against it. The very real problem is going to be that Black gets to stack the
Rooks. Thus White's response is ""forced."" Rfe1 Rde7",True
