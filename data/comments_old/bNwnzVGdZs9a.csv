1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6,"It's rather amazing to me that this opening variation should continue to be the primary defense of many top GMs. It was invented in the 1950s by Najdorf (originally of Poland, but after World War II of Argentina) and fought over throughout the 1960s and 70s. Bobby Fischer utilized it and honed it like a knife. Many years later, after other defenses have been tried and many discarded, this is Kasparov's favorite. It's interesting also to note that there are a zillion 6th moves White can choose from, and the one played most these days by the top GMs is 6. Be3, a move (and system) created by GM Robert Byrne, a New Yorker who was a childhood (and perhaps lifelong) friend of Bobby Fischer. Did he invent this opening variation to combat Fischer? I don't know. It was taken up by Englishmen and made more popular in the 1980s and 90s. Now it's commonplace.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3,"Fischer preferred 6. Bc4 and that's still considered good, but it's not to the taste of today's players. I suppose I should also add that 6. Bg5 was ""all the rage"" during the 1960s and 70s when Fischer played actively, but his ""Poison Pawn Variation"" (after 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2) is still considered good, and it's one reason 6. Bg5 isn't played much now.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5,"Particularly against 6. Be2 this move (6...e5) was Fischer's response. It is named for Opocensky, but like many variations, Fischer played it a lot and made it popular. It makes sense that as White he'd play 6. Bc4 if he thought Black might play 6...e5, leaving the c4-f7 diagonal open.",True
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3,"Now there are a couple of weaknesses in Black's pawn structure, so White will have a clear idea of where to play (d5, d6, b6) . However, Pe5 controls d4 and with ...Bc8-e6 Black controls d5 pretty well too. Only Bf8 will be noticably bad.",True
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3,There's no immediate need for this. He wants to play g2-g4-g5 to gain better control of d5. Playing Qd1-d2 is mainly to prepare O-O-O and I guess he doesn't want to commit to that yet.,True

Ng3 Nxg3 14. hxg3,"White gains by having the open h-file, but Black retains sufficient control of the central squares. It's also less clear where White's king will be safe. After the king-side pawns advanced he wouldn't be expected to O-O, though he might play Ke1-f2. With Black's queen-side pawns far advanced it's highly unlikely he'll O-O-O. On the other hand, Black's king seems perfectly safe, but Rh8 is going to be out of play if Ke8 stays in the middle of that rank.",True
