1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4,"Interesting idea to play 4.d4. Bb5 and Bc4 are also
possible here. Black heads into the ""Little Center."" Several idea to attack
this center would be to get in f5, Bxe6, Nxe6, Nd5. The move e5 can also be
disruptive to the Black center. Another common idea for attacking this set up
is to play c4. There are two essential elements here. First, prevent Black
from freeing himself with /\d5. Second, play the KB to the a2 - g8 diagonal
(Bobby Fischer). This opportunistic diagonal has paid rich rewards to many
players. Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White tends to attack on the
Kingside, while Black aims at the Queenside. Control these and win. Black
meanwhile wants to pressure the pawn at e4 (and support /\d5). Black's main
strategy tends to be to head to the endgame as soon as possible (the pawn
structure favors Black in the endgame). All this would fit into the idea of
playing 4.d4",True

persistent pressure thanks to the Bishop pair.",True

be doubled e - pawns or black will have to give up material. Rxd8+ Bxd8 Rd1",True

get a Rook to the one of the files. The ""perfect"" move is to play 20. Rd3.
After this I don't think that Black can defend himself. For instance, Black
has two moves that make sense 20/\Nh7 and 20/\Qe7. On 20/\Nh7 21. Qh5 c5 22.
Rh3 f5 23. Qe8+ Kg7 24. Qxe6 shatters Blacks pawns and exposes Black to all
sorts of interesting things. On 20/\Qe7 21.Rg3 Black is in serious trouble. 21/
\Ng4 22. Rh3+ Nh6 23. Rxh6# or 21/\Qf8 22. Bd3 e4 23. Rh3+ Nh7 24. Qh5 Qg7 25.
Nxe4. Then there is 22..Nh7 23. Qxe5+ f6 24. Qxe6. From this point on White's
game begins to deteriorate. Black must have been very happy at this point.
Qh6+ Kg8 Qg5+ Kf8 Qh6+ Ke7 Qg7 e4 Bc4 Qe5 Nb5 Bc7 Also working is 26/\e3.
Stronger is 26/\Bd5 27. Be2 e3 g3 Your strength, in this game, is a strong
positional feel that is rare in young players. You seem to have two weaknesses.
First, you do not demonstrate a willingness to attack, even though you had
positional justification. This tends to come from lack of experience and lack
of knowing basic attacking motifs. Second, you don't seem to understand the
idea of the opening. (Very few do, in OTB. Play postal and you will learn the
ideas very quickly or lose badly, quickly.) I would suggest that you switch to
the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on your positional awareness. Work on the
common tactical ideas, learn patterns. Maybe one thing that will help you in
the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a ""change up"" style (what you
pull out for fun or when you've been scouted at a tourney). This will add
spice (not to mention confusion) to your opponent's life. If you want to work
on your positional understanding, study the games of Karpov - who just happens
to be creative attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have never
studied his games.) Also read Silman's ""How to Reassess"" book, if you haven't
done so already. When all else fails, I'm looking for new students! (LOL) e3",True
