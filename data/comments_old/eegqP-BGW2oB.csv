1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3,"""Lasker gave in one of his books (""Chess for Fun
and Chess for Blood"", I believe) the order 1 d4 f5 2 Nf3 e6 3 Nc3, with a
comment about  White's third move not being good."" (Marshall Chess Club 23.01.
2001)  Of course, if 3 Nc3 is not good after 1 d4 f5 2 Nf3 e6, then it will
also not be good after 1 d4 e6 2 Nf3 f5.  It is natural to want to believe
Edward Lasker himself, but, unfortunately he gave different versions of the
game in different places, so he must have goofed at least once, and possibly
more than once.  ""Chess for Fun and Chess  for Blood"", was written decades
after the game was played.  The other occasion when Edward Lasker wrote about
the game was six years after the event.  Edward Winter found the 1 d4 e6 2 Nf3
f5 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Be7 5 Bxf6 Bxf6 6 e4 fxe4 7 Nxe4 b6  8 Ne5 0-0 9 Bd3 Bb7
version in Bachmann's  Schachjahrbuch 1912.  Richard Forster said that  this
version was also given in ""the column in De  Amsterdammer, 17 November 1912,
by Loman,  who was a regular at the City of London Chess  Club"". (Louis Blair
