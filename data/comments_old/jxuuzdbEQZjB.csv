1. d4,E81: King's Indian: Saemisch: 6th move deviations (including 6 Be3 c6),True
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7,Not the standard move here. Most common is 6... e5 fighting for the center. Black could also play 6... c5. The move played allows white to develop his g1 Knight safely to f2 via h3.,True
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2,"A typical move in this position. White prepares to castle long and Pawn storm the black King. However, 7. Nh3-f2 is a better idea. Seirawan-Istratescu, 1994 continued 7. Nh3 e5 8. d5 Nh5?! 9. g4 Nf4 10. Nxf4 exf4 11. Bxf4 Ne5 12. Be2 f5 13. exf5 gxf5 14. O-O fxg4 15. fxg4 h5!? 16. Bxe5 Bxe5 17. Qd3! gave white a clear advantage according to Seirawan in his book, Winning Chess Brilliancies. However, GM Nunn had prepared a special treatment of this line.",True
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3,A mistake. The move is logically designed to prevent black's Knights from going to g4 after white plays the natural f4 to drive away black's Knight on e5. Few better moves spring to mind for white here. 9. Bd3 Nxd3 uncoordinates the white position. 9. Ne2? Nxc4 loses material. Watch how black immediately targets the weakened g3 square.,True
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3 Nh5 10. Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5,This move invites the Pawn fork which sacrifices black material for no clear tactical advantage. After the natural 11... gxf5 12. f4 Ng6 13. g3 would make black's Knights harmless. White is nearly forced to fork the black pieces in order to develop his own pieces.,True

Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5 12. g4 Rxf3 13. gxh5 Qf8,"The point of this entire line of sacrifice is made with this move. The white King is stuck in the center. Castling Queenside would run into Bh6 immediately. White finds it difficult to develop his kingside pieces. Black has the initiative with the f-file battery. Therefore, white will find it hard to devise a defensive plan.",True

White cannot remove black's Rook on f3 because 16. Nxf3 Nxf3+ 17. Kd1 Bf5 18. Bg3 (not 18. Bd3 Nd4! 19. Bxd4 Qf3+ 20. Qe2 Qxh1+ 21. Kc2 Qxa1 wins material) 18... Qe3! 19. Bf2 Qxe4 20. Qxe4 Bxe4 21. Bg2 Rf8 gives black a superior end game. The black Queen assumes a dominating position in the middle of the board planning Bc8-f5 and Ra8-f8.,True
