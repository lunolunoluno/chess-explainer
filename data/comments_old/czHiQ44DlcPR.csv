1. e4,"Theoretically this is Ponomariov's best chance to win and get back into the race for first. But, in practice Vallejo Pons has proven tough to beat.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3,"Finally, someone chooses not to play c2-c4. However, 5. Bd3 is considered better by most people. Nc3 is a waiting target for ...b7-b5 or might be pinned by ...Bf8-b4. Black usually plays strongly on the dark squares, as in many Sicilian Defense variations, with White defending Nd4 & Nc3 and trying to find a way to open lines to Ke8 or make something of the half open d-file.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 b5 6. Bd3,preparing to meet ...b5-b4 with Nc3-e2,True
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 b5 6. Bd3 Bb7,Taking aim at Pe4 isn't going to succeed the way it would in many other variations. Here White has taken extra precaution to keep Pe4 safe and left Nd4 a little weaker. Black should adjust his play in recognition of this.,True

Ne3 O-O,"For a position which has arisen from a Sicilian Defense this is very odd. The queen-side pawn formation is quite unusual and White's bishops on the d-file and Pg3 are peculiar. White should try to play on the d-file and perhaps try to win Pb3. He shouldn't allow Black to open the f-file with ...f7-f5. That would make Bc6 too good. So, Bd3-b5 to trade bishops might be useful. But, Pe4 needs defense, so Ne3 must move first.",True

Rd6,"Black has absolutely no offense, but he does have a weak Pe6 and trapped Qb3. White threatens Ra1-a3xb3. This looked as easy as Ivanchuk's victory and is more to be expected than the struggle Kasparov had to endure before gaining the full point against Vallejo Pons. It also puts Ponomariov right back into a tie for first with Kasparov. This sets up the climactic struggle between those two in the next round -- winner take all!",True
