I don't know if anybody still bothers to think about these things conceptually, but it has always helped me to remind myself at this point why I am sacking a pawn.  Right, it clears the 'b' and 'c' files and the h8-a1, h7-b1 diagonals, all of which lead to white's king.  Sounds good...",True

Qc5 Qb7,"14...Qb8 is also interesting.  14...Qb7 had been scoring badly at the top level recently, but that kind of cutting-edge theory rarely filters down to affect my games.  Basically I had played this for a long time, and I had never gotten burnt, so I didn't see any reason to fix it.  For all I know however, this is the losing blunder according to Deeper Blue.",False

Bd3 Rab8 17. b3 Rfc8,"So far we had both used something like a minute, but I am almost sure that after this move black has inadequate compensation.  Sloppy preparation and sloppy form at the board (I should have slowed down and at least considered 17...Bxd3 at this point) cost me the game.",True
