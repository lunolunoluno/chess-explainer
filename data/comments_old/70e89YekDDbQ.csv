1. e4,"At this point in the tournament Shirov has drawn with everyone but Adams and has beaten Ivanchuk (3rd-5th place finish) , but lost (with Black) to Anand, Adams and Vallejo Pons (3rd-5th and 6th place finishers) . This is an odd sort of result except that each and every one of these contestants is very strong. One gets the sense Shirov is trying to figure out how to beat the top players and this tournament was (for Shirov) as much for experimentation as anything; or maybe he's just in a bit of a slump.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6,"Already this is a surprise. I can't recall the last time Kasparov played this. Here are some of his ""surprises"" from the tournament: round 1 as Black against Vallejo Pons' English Opening he played 2...e5; round 8 as White against Vallejo Pons' Sicilian Defense he played c2-c4 to establish a Maroczy Bind; round 7 against Shirov's Sicilian Defense he played 3. Bb5 and, now in this Sicilian Defense game against Shirov he has played 2...Nc6.",True

He risks a lot with this choice because a loss here and a win by Ponomariov would give Ponomariov a tie for first with Kasparov.",False

There aren't so many players who wish to enter into a tactical melee this quickly. The strategic idea is that White's bishop isn't very good and this way it gives it's life to make Na3 very good and to open some lines to Ke8, so it will never find a safe haven.",True
