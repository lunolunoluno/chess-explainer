1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O,"This is reasonable, but it is known that black gets a good
game in the Berlin Defense (which is ...Nf6 without ...a6 in the Ruy Lopez). I
prefer either 4. d3 or 4. Qe2, keeping the position closed, and preserving the
winning chances for white.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5. Re1,"If black plays properly should lead
to equality. Theory suggests 5. d4 as the best chance for an advantage.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5. Re1 Ng5,"Dubious. Now white can try 6. Nxg5 Qxg5 7. d4 (notice this move causes the c1
bishop to hit the black queen) to try to fight for the initiative. Instead 5. .
.. Nd6 would give black equality with no problems. For example, 5. ... Nd6 6.
Bxc6 dxc6 (to open up the diagonally for the light-squared bishop) 7. Nxe5 Be7,
with a very reasonable game for black.",True

straight away? Normally in Ruy Lopez, c3 is needed to help get in the d4 push,
but not here. There was nothing preventing white from playing 7. d4 and 8. Nc3,
completing development.",True

multi-purpose move. ...c6 does the following: a) frees the black d-pawn to
move (it was pinned before) b) opens the a5-d8 diagonal for the black queen,
and c) helps establish a strong pawn center on d5.",False

c1. White's best chance for an advantage is a king-side buildup. Here, I would
choose 11. Nbd2, with the idea of Nd2-f1-g3 and Bc2, and you can see a lot of
pressure on black's king-side.",True

pawn that can recapture take toward the center. In this case, that would be 14.
hxg3. The only time you don't follow this principle, is something VERY
specific is to be gained by not doing so. Here, this opens the f-line, but
that leads to nothing. Also, this loosens the g1-a7 diagonal. As we'll see
later in the game, black takes advantage of this fact.",True

Notice that if your pawn was on f2, black would only get 2 pawns, because then
the recapture on d4 wouldn't be check, and you could defend your b-pawn.",True

not. In this case, black gets connected, passed (passed pawn = pawn unopposed
