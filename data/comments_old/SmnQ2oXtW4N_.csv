1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3,"This move co
ntraddicts the strategical principles indicated by the theory. Since Turn knew
that Mikenas had a deep theoretical preparation, he decided this line of play
in order to surprise the opponent.",True
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3,"A bit inaccurate. The
following continuation would have lead to interesting complications: 6. Bd2
Bb7 7. Qg3 O-O 8. d5",True

8. Qxg7 after 8... Rg8 9. Qh6 Rxg2 would have given a very promising position
to Black.",True

period: enthusiasm, courage and imagination. Which is the general strategy of
the young people: attack, and don't care about possible losses.",False

was 12. Qxd4 although even in this case Black can keep some more possibilites
in view of the endgame. For example: 12... Bc5 13. Qe5 Rxg2 14. Ne4 Bxe4 15.
Bxe4 Ng4 16. Qh8+ Ke7 17. Qxd8+ Rxd8 18. Ne5 Bb4+ 19. Kf1 Rf2+ 20. Kg1 Re2 and
