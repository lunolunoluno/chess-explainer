"Black has developed in an unusual way, omitting the maneuver ... Qe8-h5, and played instead to get his Queen Bishop outside the pawn chain at once. In consequence, the e-pawn has lost its natural protection, and White can attack this base immediately",True," The comment identifies a specific, potentially flawed move and its consequences, indicating a misunderstanding of strategic principles.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

"Correct. Black adopts a waiting policy, not wishing to dissolve the central framework. The points d5 and e5 are well enough defended, and in such positions the closure by e5 is nothing to fear",True," The comment suggests a strategic retreat, a deviation from active development, which is a key element of the mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

"The two Bishops, which White obtains by this move, are not very useful in a closed position like this. If White had decided to exchange the Knight which stood at e5, he should have done it a move earlier and not for the Bishop, but for the Knight atd7",True," The comment offers a specific critique of the Bishop's placement, suggesting it's not optimal.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

"It is evident that White's operations have achieved less than nothing. His Queen Bishop is a spectator, and it is Black's Knight at e4 which controls the situation in the centre. The attempt to undermine the Knight which follows now also leads to nothing",True," The comment identifies a weakness in White's strategy and suggests Black's piece placement is decisive, indicating a flawed move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.
