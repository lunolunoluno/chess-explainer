"Imagine that your computer needs repair. You get your Acme Handy Dandy Computer Repair Tool Kit out and start to repair the beast. What do you have to do first? Answer: Open the kit so you can get the tools out. You can hit the computer with the tool kit all you want, but it won't fix the computer. You must get the tools out of the kit. Chess is the same way. If you want to crush your opponent, you must open the game so you can get your tools (pieces) into position where they are useful. Moving the Queen's Bishop to e3 blocks the potential development of the King's Bishop.",True," The comment offers a metaphor to illustrate a tactical mistake, suggesting a need for strategic planning rather than simply moving pieces.",1.

"Idea: Do no t move a piece a second time in the opening without a specific reason. It is almost always a bad idea. The problem with moving a piece a second time is that wastes time. Let's say you have only 15 minutes to fix your computer and you take 14 minutes to get the Acme Handy Dandy Computer Repair Tool Kit out. Remember to make the most efficient use of your TIME and moves. Second idea: count the number of squares the Knight can move to on f3 (eight), now count the number of squares it can move to on h4 (four). Because FLEXIBILITY is important, remember, ""A Knight on the rim is dim [or grim]."" Imagine a really ugly Y2K bug creeping out of the shadows and snatching a Knight you put on the edge of the board.",True," The comment offers valuable advice on avoiding redundant moves, highlighting the time inefficiency of repeatedly moving the same piece.",1.

"Here you had to move the Queen's Bishop again, if you had put it here on move 4. you would have had a spare move to make. It's like taking an extra turn. [Ever wish you could take more than one turn at a time? Here is where you can do it, legally! By playing 4.

"7. e4 takes up more space in the center. Concentrate your opening moves on the four squares in the center of the board. If your video card needs to be replaced why try to change your hard drive? Important Idea: BEFORE YOU MOVE: Ask yourself, ""What is my opponent threatening?""

"There are three ways to deal with a threat: First, move the piece that is threatened. Second, capture the piece that is attacking [in this case 9. Nxg2 wins the Bishop].

"Idea: A check is a FREE MOVE. A check is a FORCING MOVE. Always consider forcing moves first [check, threaten checkmate, winning material].
