This is the Modern Benoni Defence. Here Black develops his Bishop on g7 by playing... g6 and the move... c5 gives Black control of the dark squares in the centre.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it describes the Modern Benoni Defence and the purpose of the moves g6 and c5, but does not address the specific mistake that occurred.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6"
"Not the best square for the Bishop. Better would have been 7. Nf3, 8.h3 and then placing the Bishop to d3 as per the latest theory.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies a potential improvement in the game plan by suggesting an alternative move (7. Nf3, 8. h3, and placing the Bishop to d3), indicating that the previously played move was not optimal.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e2"
"Black puts pressure on the e - Pawn and also prevents its advance. Later Black plays on the Queenside for... b5,... b4 etc.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake made by Black, as it highlights the pressure exerted on a key pawn and the potential pawn advance to gain space and chances on the Queenside.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to e8"
"White plans to develop his Bishop to f4 before playing Nd2. As will be seen, Tal brilliantly refutes this idea. It looks better to play 10. Nd2 as recommended by theory.",True,"

This comment explains the mistake made by the player as it correctly identifies that the move allows for an unexpected refutation by Tal, which would have been better avoided by playing 10. Nd2.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2"
"Black's idea is to play... Nc7,... Rb8 followed by... b5. Also the Knight can be used for other purpose as demonstrated in the game.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only states Black's potential plans and does not provide insight into the error in the previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a6"
Better was 11. Re1 Nc7 12. Bf4 Rb8 13. a4 a6 14. a5 b5 15. axb5 Rb6 with chances for both the sides.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player by suggesting an alternative sequence of moves that could have improved the position for both sides.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4"
It was not possible to play 12...Nfd5 due to 13. exd Bc3 14. bxc Re2 15. cxb,True,"
The comment correctly explains the mistake, as it outlines the possible sequence of moves that would result in a loss for the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e4"
Forced. Since after 14. Bd3 Nd3 15 Qd3 Be4 Black remains a Pawn up. Black has compensation since he will get another Pawn on d5 with a tempo and also White pieces are in a cramped position. Practically it is difficult for White to find the best path.,False,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake but does not explain why the move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10.

Instead 19. Bb7? is met by 19...Rab8. Now White is having some hope in the opposite coloured Bishop endgame/middlegame.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as the suggested move (19. Bb7?) was a weak choice, offering Black the possibility to counterattack with 19...Rab8, giving Black a potential advantage in the opposite colored bishop endgame/middlegame.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19. Qc2,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2"
Black is a Pawn up but the most important factor is that it provides a fine outpost for the Bishop in the centre.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the strategic importance of the move that allows the Bishop to potentially control the center, despite the material disadvantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19. Qc2 Re7 20. Bf3 Rae8 21. Rad1 Bd4,"This is a game between Averbakh, Y (as White) and Tal, M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d4"
White has placed all his Pawns on the light squares and avoids giving Black any target of attack. Now White is planning to exchange a pair of Rooks which will ease the pressure. Even after that the material on the board is enough for Tal to build up the decisive attack.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as the error in the move was unrelated to the placement of pawns, exchange of rooks, or the potential for Tal's attack.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.

Here 24...Qe6 would have been met by 25. Qc4 and 24...Qe7 with 25. Bc6.,True,"

The comment identifies a mistake by suggesting alternative moves the opponent could have played in response to the player's move, indicating a missed opportunity for the player to gain a better position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.

White puts his King on a White square and plans to play g3 as a counter to Blacks... Qf4 and... Be5.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the problematic king's position and the ineffective plan involving g3, Qf4, and Be5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.

Last move played: White plays King to h1"
"(28. Bc4?, Be5 28. Qg6+ (29. g3, Qf3+ with the idea of 30...h3) 29...Kf8 wins for Black.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting a tactical error leading to a potential win for Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19. Qc2 Re7 20. Bf3 Rae8 21.

Intending Bf3.,True,"

The comment ""Intending Bf3"" explains the mistake because it reveals the player's intended move, which indicates that the move played was not in line with their plan.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.

Last move played: White plays Queen to d1"
"Better would have been 30. Kg2, since 30...Bf2 is met by 31. Qc2. So Black may continue 30...Bc3 31. Bd3 (Else 31...Rd2) 31...Qc6+ 32. Kg1 Qd5 33. Be2 Qg5 34. Qc1 Qf6 35. Rd1 Bd4 36. Rf1 hxg 37. hxg Qe5! winning a second Pawn.",True,"

"(31. Qf3, Qf3+ and 32...hxg is hopeless for White.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that the move Qf3+ leads to a losing position for White due to the forced capture of the White queen.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.

Last try would have been 35. Qe5+ Kh7 36. Qf6! When 36...Qh3 leads to a draw after 37. Qf7+ Kh6 38. Qf8+ Kh5 39. Qh8+ Kg4 40. Qc8+ Kh4 41. Qh8+ etc. However after 36...Qd5+ 37. Bg2 Qg2+ 38. Kg2 Bd4+ Black wins.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by providing alternative moves the opponent could have played that would lead to a draw, and also an alternative move that leads to Black winning, clearly explaining why the original move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Na6 11. Bf4 Nb4 12. Qb1 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bf5 14. Nfd2 Nxd5 15. Bxd6 Nf6 16. Bf3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Bxe4 Qxd6 19.
