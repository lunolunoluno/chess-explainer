#I think this is new. 11...d6 was played in van der Stemen - Karner Tallin 1987 and 11...hxg5!? between Balashov - Tiviakov St. Petersburg 1993 which continued 12.d6 Nc6 13.dxe7 Qxe7 14.Bxg5 d5 but I didn't fancy ny two N's v 2 B's!,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, comparing the move 11...d6 to a similar situation in both historical games and stating that the move was not preferred due to the resulting position favoring White.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6"," 'The move played by Black, moving the bishop to d6, reminded me of two similar games from the past. In van der Stemen vs. Karner in Tallin 1987, we see 11...d6 transitioning to 12.d6 Nc6 13.dxe7 Qxe7 14.Bxg5 d5. Similarly, in Balashov vs. Tiviakov from St. Petersburg 1993, Black's 11...hxg5!? led to 12.d6 Nc6 13.dxe7 Qxe7 14.Bxg5 d5. However, those sequences are not favorable for Black. It seems to me that the situation is uncomfortable for Black without clear tactical or positional justification. It's risky and doesn't seem to offer a solid plan.'"
A look at the pawn structure suggests the future course of the game. Black has passed pawn Qside and White should push the e and f pawns aiming to obtain a winning attack with e5. Whoever executes his plan first wins.,True,"

The comment implies that the player's mistake was not recognizing the importance of the pawn structure and the need to push the e and f pawns for a potential winning attack, which shows an understanding of the implications of the mistake.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a6"," After the last move, Black's Knight to a6 doesn't align with the strategic plan of either side. White should focus on advancing the e and f pawns to create a solid pawn structure, which could lead to a strong attack with e5. The player who manages to execute this plan first will have the advantage."
I think this is wrong. He should go 16.b3! He has to play b3 anyway. The move played just clogs up the e file and delays White's strategic play of e4-e5 etc which never gets going.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a mistake by explaining how the move clogs up critical files and delays strategic play, indicating the player's move was suboptimal.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"," 'I believe the move 16.b3 was not the best choice. By playing this, they are unnecessarily complicating the e-file and delaying their strategic plan, such as the pawn break e4-e5 which remains unexecuted.'"
With this move White anounces his intention to attack Black's King!,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player as it seems to misinterpret the player's intentions which might not be focused on attacking Black's King.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

Last move played: White plays Rook to d4",-
"An understandable mistake, the c3 square is very weak. The correct way to defend was by 28.Bd4 viz 28...d6 29. Rf4! # 28...Nb2.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move was a mistake due to a weak c3 square that could be targeted, and provides the alternative defense move that would have been stronger.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

Rc1,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to c1"," They played Rook to c1, which is a weak move since the c3 square is not defended. The better defense would have been 28...d6 followed by 29...Rf4."
Now White has real problems with the f5 Bishop. With 29.Qe4 Nc4 30.Rxc4 Rxc4 31.Qb1 Rc3 Black is winning. Also 29...Qxf5 wins. Therefore White is forced into...,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by White, as it demonstrates several tactical problems with the move and provides possible continuations that lead to a winning position for Black.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

Rc1 Nb2,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b2"," White faces significant trouble with the f5 Bishop. Black's move Nc4 followed by c4 and Rc3 puts White in a losing position. Additionally, Black's Qxf5 would lead to a win. Consequently, White has no good alternatives."
"The only square for the Rook! I spent some time trying to find a way to win this piece, but was happy to leave it well offside!",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player by mentioning the Rook's positioning and the player's realization of leaving it well offside.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

Be4 a5 34. Bg2 f5 35. Rh4,"This is a game between Milligan, Bernard (as White) and Beecham, Richard (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to h4"," A Rook's positioning was suboptimal, with Black and White considering various strategies to advance their pieces, but ultimately, White's Rook ended up being offside."
"Strange, especially when 37.e4!? looks a far better try.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies that the player made a mistake by not choosing the more optimal move of 37.e4!, which would have likely led to a better position.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

"# With Bernards last move 44.h3 came the offer if 44...Qd4!! White Resigns. The Correspondence Chess card also had a photograph of Bernard from the 70's, kipper tie and Gorilla hair style. I questioned his parentage and accepted his resignation. This game will always remind me of all that is good in Correspondence Chess.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake, as it highlights the consequences of the move and provides context from the game's correspondence chess background, although it includes personal anecdotes that seem unrelated to the chess game.",1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Qc2 c5 8. d5 exd5 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. cxd5 Bd6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 Re8 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 b5 16. Be3 Qf6 17.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to a8"," '# Bernard's move 44.h3 was a poor play, it lacked strategic depth and offered an easy win for Black.
