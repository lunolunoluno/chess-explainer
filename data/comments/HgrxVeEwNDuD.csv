A quite satisfactory developement for the knight which is why it does not matter that it is deprived of c3. There is nothing wrong with the temporary blocking of the queen bishop for the Lopez is a positional opening in which events develop slowly. But 6. Bg5 or 6. 0-0 followed by 7.

To maneuver the knight to e3 putting pressure on Black's d5 and f5. This procedure was originated by Steinitz in one of the games of his match with Blackburne in 1876. Later it became standard in many variations of the Lopez. Also very good was first 0-0 and then Re1 followed by Nf1. But Steinitz was fond of delaying castling when such a strategy was playable In this way he kept open the option of castling on the queenside.,True," The comment provides context for why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting a potentially flawed strategic approach.",1. e4 e5 2.

There is a good point to this seeming waste of time. White plans to respond with Qe2 if Black should play d5 guarding his king pawn and preventing the exchange of queens. If Black should then play Bd7 White wants to have a retreat for his king bishop at c2 so that Black cannot force its exchange with Nd4.,True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic plan to avoid a disadvantage.",1. e4 e5 2.

This would be a good move if Black planned to follow it up with Nb6 and d5 advancing in the center. However Black played it with the idea of continuing in this way; Nc5 Ne6 (The knight will be loose on c5 after Black plays d5.) Ne7 and finally d5. An awfully slow plan! Black had two good alternatives; 8...a6 followed by b5 and d5 (or Na5 followed by c5 putting pressure on Whites d4 if White plays Bb3 instead of of Bc2 and 8...d5 at once. Indeed there is a certain logic to the latter move; White has lost a tempo with 8. Ba4 so Black can afford to lose one by moving his queen pawn twice.,True," The comment offers a plausible alternative and explains the reasoning behind a potential improvement, indicating a thoughtful assessment of the situation.",1. e4 e5 2.

Starting an attack against Black's king. White plans to play h5 and hxg6 opening his rook file. By playing this move White has definitely committed himself to queenside castling for his kingside will be too exposed for him to castle there.,True, The comment accurately describes a risky opening move that exposes the king.,1. e4 e5 2.

Much better was 13...hxg6 after which Black's game might still be tenable.
