"This position is known as the Center Counter, or Scandinavian defense. While objectively sound for black, I don't recommend it as this early queen sortie, as it doesn't help black's central control much, plus black always has to be careful where he moves his queen again, as the monarch is always pushed around by White with an eventual Nc3 or c4. If black isn't careful, he could lose his queen easily, as this game demonstrates.",True," The comment provides specific reasons why the move was considered a mistake, highlighting weaknesses in black's strategic position and potential for a loss of the queen.",1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5,This is a game between W16 (as White) and B16 (as Black).
