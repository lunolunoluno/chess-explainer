"As a coach of children, I teach them insanely aggressive openings up until they are over the 1500 mark. From 1500 - 1800 they learn the Colle - K. It/^s good for handling better opponents with explosive possibilities. After 1800 I require them to play the Torre and introduce them to the Queen/^s Gambit. The Colle introduces the player to games that are (+)close[+] (less given to the luck that the opponent will miss something). In other words, creating advantages from equal positions. Also it stretches them to understand the position and play accordingly.",True," The comment suggests a flawed opening strategy, potentially hindering development and positional understanding.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"Again 11/\Nce5 immediately and permanently ends all hope for White to achieve an advantage by liquidating the center pawns, liquidating a set of minor pieces (giving Black the (+)magical[+] Bishop pair), and neutralize the White space advantage in the center and King side.

"White at this point has control of the game and has all the possibilities. It is more or less a matter of time. These are excellent training positions. Now how will White cash in on his dominance? Nbd4 Ouch. Between the next four moves you demonstrate that you do not understand the position. Consider Be3 with the idea of Bc5. Also consider Qg3 with the idea of Bxh6. When you are up positionally, look for ways to tie the opponent/^s position down more. Look for the most forcing moves. The two redeeming factors are that Black is uncoordinated and White has both Bishops controlling the Kingside. Nxc6 Bxc6 Be3 Rc8 Qh4 You completely miss the point of the position. You must learn to read the position! You have complete dominance on the Kingside thanks to your Bishops. You have complete control of the dark squares thanks to Black/^s lack of dark square Bishop. You are playing a virtual piece up thanks to the bad Black Bishop. You have a fine out post for the Knight on d4. How can you take advantage of these ideas? First you can try 24. Bb6 Qc7 25. Nd5. Now you can consider Nxe6 prying open the middle and giving you a passed pawn. With the two active Bishops White should finish Black off quickly. This is one of those double-edged moves. I like it because it sets up an interesting defense but Black mishandles it and never uses the idea.",True," The comment provides specific suggestions for improving the position, indicating a failure to understand the strategic implications of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"f4 Black/^s losing move. The idea of /\Be8 was to play /\Bg6, which looks like it stabilizes the position - for now. Bd4 When in control, keep it patient and simple. When behind the defense must be patient but also active. Many times, the defense wants to complicate a position in hopes that he opponent will lose the way. An idea that would be very difficult to risk in OTB play would be 26. Bxf4. In postal, I would have given it a try. The trade is to give Black the White Queenside in exchange for an attack on the Black Kingside. This will work if you get the King (which might prove difficult). However if you don/^t get the King, you have given Black a huge end game advantage. Always play with an eye on the endgame. At this point, I like your choice.",True," The comment offers potential strategic insights into the move's weaknesses and suggests a risky trade for endgame advantage, indicating a flawed assessment of the positionâ€™s long-term potential.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

Rf7 Black makes his second losing move. The Bishop at e8 is badly placed now. It keeps the Queen and Rook from aiding the defense. You are now playing everything on one (the Rook at f7).
