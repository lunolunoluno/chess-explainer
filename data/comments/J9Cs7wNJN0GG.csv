At the time I thought it might be one of those nearly unsound but dangerous side variations, something like the Sicilian Pin Variation (2...e6 3.d4 cd 4. Nd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4). After some calculation I felt sure that I had found the critical line, so...",False

Ne4 Qb6,"This was the first surprise after my analysis at move seven, where I only expected 12...Qa5+, but I couldn't figure out black's idea. 12...Qb6 came very quickly of course, and I started to get that nervous feeling. The main ideas include 13...Qxb2, and 13/14...Qb4+ which may pick up a loose piece along the fourth rank.",True

Bxg5 Qxb2 15. c4,"I finally resorted to this after rejecting the intended 15.O-O Qxe5 16.Nf6+ Nxf6 17.Bxf6 due to 17...Qxh2. The idea is simply to make black's knight move, but first I have to be willing to look at the position after 15...Qxg2.
