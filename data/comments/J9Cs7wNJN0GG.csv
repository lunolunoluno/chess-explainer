"This was a surprise, although I learned later that the move has recently become popular. At the time I thought it might be one of those nearly unsound but dangerous side variations, something like the Sicilian Pin Variation (2...e6 3.d4 cd 4. Nd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4). After some calculation I felt sure that I had found the critical line, so...",True,"

The comment suggests that the player initially thought the move was a risky but intriguing variation, similar to the Sicilian Pin Variation, but later realized there was a critical line they missed.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Nc6,"This is a game between Hartwig, Thomas (as White) and Rensch, Daniel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"This was the first surprise after my analysis at move seven, where I only expected 12...Qa5+, but I couldn't figure out black's idea. 12...Qb6 came very quickly of course, and I started to get that nervous feeling. The main ideas include 13...Qxb2, and 13/14...Qb4+ which may pick up a loose piece along the fourth rank.",True,"

Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6"
"I finally resorted to this after rejecting the intended 15.O-O Qxe5 16.Nf6+ Nxf6 17.Bxf6 due to 17...Qxh2. The idea is simply to make black's knight move, but first I have to be willing to look at the position after 15...Qxg2. I decided, rightly it turns out, that there is nothing else and that the position at least remains unclear after 16.Rf1.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's misstep by acknowledging the player's intention to disrupt black's knight movement with a kingside pawn storm, and the subsequent realization that other options, such as taking on g2, were still viable.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Very strong. If I move the rook then black has simply 17...cxd5. So eventually I realized that my next move, bizarre as it looks, is forced.",True,"

The comment explains that the player realized later that their initial move, which was considered a mistake, was actually a forced move due to the opponent's response.",1. e4 c5 2.
