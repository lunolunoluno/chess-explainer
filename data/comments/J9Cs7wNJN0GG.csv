"This was the first surprise after my analysis at move seven, where I only expected 12...Qa5+, but I couldn't figure out black's idea. 12...Qb6 came very quickly of course, and I started to get that nervous feeling. The main ideas include 13...Qxb2, and 13/14...Qb4+ which may pick up a loose piece along the fourth rank.",True," The comment describes a potential miscalculation and a subsequent, somewhat frantic, move sequence, suggesting a flawed understanding of the position.",1. e4 c5 2.

"I finally resorted to this after rejecting the intended 15.O-O Qxe5 16.Nf6+ Nxf6 17.Bxf6 due to 17...Qxh2. The idea is simply to make black's knight move, but first I have to be willing to look at the position after 15...Qxg2.
