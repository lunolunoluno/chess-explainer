"To give some idea of Tarrasch's style of analysis and clarity with which he could set out the essentials of the position, we give here his note on this position: ""Black has far and away the better game. As regards material it is quite likely in the endgame a Rook and two Bishops will turn out to be stronger than Rooks and a Knight; furthermore the b-pawn is bound to fall. Black's centre is very strong, and teh advance of the d-pawn and c-pawn will produce a pair of united passed pawns. White is still uncastled, and Black can play to preven Kingside castling by ... Ra8 and ... Ba6. The White Rooks have not a single open file at their disposal, and the Knight is pinned. In reality White has only his Queen in play. It is now up to Black to utilize his chances tactically. The simplest way thought perhaps not the best, would be ... Qc5 followed by ... Qxb6 and then advance the c-pawn. Black plays however to prevent castling, to deprive the opponent of all good moves, to force all his pieces - especially Knight - to unfavourable positions and finally reduce him to desparation",True," The comment offers a detailed analysis of the position's strategic implications, suggesting a misjudgment of Black's potential.",1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3.
