"Polgar is one of few top GMs who have stuck with the King's Indian Defense, almost exclusively.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it simply states Polgar's consistent use of the King's Indian Defense, without addressing the specific move in question or providing insight into its quality.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g7"
"7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 (Aronin-Taimanov Var.) has been the most popular, but 7. d5 (Petrosian Var.) and 7. Be3 (Gligoric Var.) are also played regularly. Black doesn't want to let Be3 remain so actively placed, where it supports Pd4, so Black usually threatens to capture it by ...Ng4. It's important for Black to force a simplification of some kind in the central pawn formation, so as to know how best to develop the other pieces.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by discussing the strategic aspects of the move and suggesting alternative variations that could have been played to better develop Black's pieces and challenge White's position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"
White is trying to keep the pressure on and to avoid committal pawn moves. Black has to play this part forcefully.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it suggests that White is maintaining pressure while trying to avoid making risky pawn moves, indicating that the previous move was a strategic decision rather than a blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to h4"
White might be threatening Nxg5 to force the position open (though it wins no material) .,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as White's move Nxg5 indeed creates tactical threats and forces the position to become more open, potentially leading to a disadvantageous situation for Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g3"
"Although this gives an escape square for Bg3 it seriously weakens the king-side, where White's king might soon be residing.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the potential mistake by stating that the move may offer a temporary escape square for a piece but could leave the king side vulnerable.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"
Black wants to trade at d4 and then use ...f6-f5 to uncover another threat before playing ...f5-f4 to mash Bg3.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by identifying the intent to trade pawns and uncover a tactical opportunity with...f5 to...f4, indicating a specific plan and potential error in execution.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
Black sees reason to allow a queen trade; especially when ...g5-g4 might still allow the king-side to open nicely for Black's pieces. The only cost is in leaving d5 to White.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that Black should have allowed a queen trade which would have been a better strategic decision, while also pointing out the potential for opening up the king-side for Black's pieces, despite the sacrifice of leaving d5 to White.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e5"
White notices d4 is weak and he hasn't got Be3 or Nf3 to challenge it.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out a weakness in White's pawn structure with d4 and the lack of supporting pieces like Be3 or Nf3 to defend or challenge it.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d4"
"I haven't seen this maneuver since a game of Bobby Fischer's. It's maneuvering toward f4 or h4. It takes time for knights to get to their ideal squares, whereas queens, rooks and bishops can often arrive in just a couple of moves.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by referring to the slow development of the knight compared to other pieces, which is a common issue in beginner's play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to h8"
"Black is well placed on the queen-side to meet O-O-O with ...b7-b5, so White's monarch has no perfectly safe square.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out the potential threats to the White King after O-O-O, indicating that the player might be overlooking a critical strategy.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. Ne3 Nf4 18. f3 c6 19. Bxc8 Rxc8,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on c8"
"Unblocking Bg7 to take aim at White's queen-side is another way to dissuade White from O-O-O. However, on the king-side Black's pawns are advanced and might force an opening in case of O-O.",True,"

This comment explains the mistake by discussing the strategic implications of moving the bishop to the b7 square, highlighting the potential for White to castle kingside and how it could pressure Black's advanced pawns on the king-side.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. Ne3 Nf4 18. f3 c6 19.

"White isn't castling queen-side, so Black wastes no time in continuing the king-side offensive. White's ""strong"" central position is meaningless and Black's Bg7 with Nd4 is just as useful as Nd5.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake of White not castling, which allows Black to advance the king-side offense.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. Ne3 Nf4 18. f3 c6 19. Bxc8 Rxc8 20. h4 b5 21. cxb5 cxb5 22. Bxf4 exf4 23. Ned5 a5 24. Rc1 g4,"This is a game between San Segundo Carrillo, P. (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g4"
The lack of a safe residence for White's king is most evident now.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies that the player overlooked the safety of their king, which is critical in chess strategy.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8.

a simple tactical finish,False,"

This comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as a ""simple tactical finish"" generally refers to a successful endgames strategy rather than a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. Ne3 Nf4 18. f3 c6 19.

Pg2 will cost White a piece.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as moving the pawn to g2 would leave the White king vulnerable to a potential checkmate or significant material loss.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh6 11. h3 Nc6 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Qd2 Nf7 14. Nh2 Nd4 15. Bg4 Nh8 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. Ne3 Nf4 18. f3 c6 19.
