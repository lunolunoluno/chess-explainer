"7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 (Aronin-Taimanov Var.) has been the most popular, but 7. d5 (Petrosian Var.) and 7. Be3 (Gligoric Var.) are also played regularly.

Black sees reason to allow a queen trade; especially when ...g5-g4 might still allow the king-side to open nicely for Black's pieces.

"I haven't seen this maneuver since a game of Bobby Fischer's. It's maneuvering toward f4 or h4.

"Unblocking Bg7 to take aim at White's queen-side is another way to dissuade White from O-O-O.

"White isn't castling queen-side, so Black wastes no time in continuing the king-side offensive.
