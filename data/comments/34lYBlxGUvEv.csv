"Interesting idea to play 4.d4. Bb5 and Bc4 are also possible here. Black heads into the ""Little Center."" Several idea to attack this center would be to get in f5, Bxe6, Nxe6, Nd5. The move e5 can also be disruptive to the Black center. Another common idea for attacking this set up is to play c4. There are two essential elements here. First, prevent Black from freeing himself with /\d5. Second, play the KB to the a2 - g8 diagonal (Bobby Fischer). This opportunistic diagonal has paid rich rewards to many players. Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White tends to attack on the Kingside, while Black aims at the Queenside. Control these and win. Black meanwhile wants to pressure the pawn at e4 (and support /\d5). Black's main strategy tends to be to head to the endgame as soon as possible (the pawn structure favors Black in the endgame). All this would fit into the idea of playing 4.d4",True," The comment offers potential alternative moves and strategies, suggesting the playerâ€™s mistake was a lack of considering the broader implications of the position.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Sweet. This is one of those killer positional ideas that few young players would consider.
