"Here it is obvious that the open c-file is of dominating importance. The routine idea of occupying the furthest available square on the open file is already on the cards; Black can play ... Nb6-c4. White can hardly occupy c5 just yet, not having played Pb4. From this point of view, Black is a little ahead. On the other hand, White retains the option of evicting a Black piece from c4 by playing Pb3. While Black holds the initiative, however, this may not be an easy matter",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting Blackâ€™s initiative is maintained, but introduces a tactical possibility that White can exploit.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Exchanging one pair of Rooks, White has just about freed himself. He could, of cource, play for further exchanges by Rc1, but with this Bishop move he undertakes an interesting attempt to revive his own winning chances. He vacates d3 as a round for his own Knight outpost on c5",True," The comment suggests a strategic move that potentially weakens White's position, indicating a flawed decision.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
