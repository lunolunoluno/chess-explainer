"Be3 is recommended as more flexible (Baumbach, SCC no 29.). Whatever, as Black I don't like the threats from White's d and e pawns advancing.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake as they don't favor the advancement of White's d and e pawns, suggesting that the recommended move Be3 may not address their concerns.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

The comment explains the move as a mistake because it acknowledges the player's decision to neglect the bishop development, as well as the consequences of leaving the queenside pawns split.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"a6 gives a strong defensive wall, but this pawn is my only way to attack, so push it!",False,"

The comment incorrectly describes a pawn move as an attacking move, when in reality, advancing the a-pawn is typically a defensive move aimed at preventing enemy pieces from advancing.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Threatening Ne4 then Nf6. This move would have been stronger played before Bxg7. I was more worried by Nf4 plus Be4 plus d5. So keep pushing that pawn.,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the player made a mistake by trying to win one of the isolated pawns, but fortunately, it resulted in a checkmate position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Time to use the Rb1+ threat. I expected Rba1 and a struggle to keep the a pawn.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the tactical implications of the mistake, highlighting the threats that arise from the opponent's next moves.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Threatens both Nxb2 and Rxc6. But my threat is bigger!,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights both potential threats (Nxb2 and Rxc6) but emphasizes that the player's threat was more significant, indicating a strategic oversight.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.
