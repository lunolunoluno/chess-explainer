Do you see the mate threat?,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it seems to be addressing an opponent's move that may lead to a checkmate threat, rather than analyzing the previously played move.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. dxc5 e6 5.

Threatening mate... how?,True,"

The comment implies that the move made by the player could potentially lead to a checkmate, but the opponent is questioning the viability of the threat, suggesting that it might not be a mistake but rather a brilliant strategic move.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. dxc5 e6 5.

Threatening mate: Rd3,False,"
