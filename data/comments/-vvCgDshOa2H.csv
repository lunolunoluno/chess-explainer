White tried to stop this move. The white Pawns on e4 and c4 form what is known as the Maroczy Bind or Wall. This wall is supposed to restrain black in the center. Black played this move which sacrifices a Pawn in order to gain greater freedom of movement for his pieces. Is the sacrifice worth it? In this game - yes. In clear retrospect - no.,True," The comment identifies a specific tactical concept (Maroczy Bind) and offers a subjective opinion on its value, suggesting a potential flaw in the move.",1. e4 c5 2.

"White may have missed his best chance for a win by making this natural move. Karpov himself provides us insight into this position, and how to refute the black gambit.

"White plays for the win. He reinforces his extra Pawn on d5 which black could have regained on move 11. How does black refute the loss of material? Watch how black paralyzes white, dominates the center, and gains control of more space.

"Kasparov states in his book Garry Kasparov: New World Chess Champion, A position for which I had aimed in my preparatory analysis! Black has achieved obvious advantage. White scattered his minor pieces about on either flank and are quite unable to coordinate, the placement of the Knights being particularly depressing. But black has the wonderful duo of Bf5 and Nd3 which completely paralyzes all three white major pieces - a very rare occurrence in a practical game!",True," The comment provides specific analysis of the resulting position, suggesting the mistake was due to a lack of coordination and strategic planning.",1. e4 c5 2.

"A very excel lent move. Black is not content to merely capture the d5 Pawn. Instead, he wants to reinforce the d3-Knight with Nd7-e5 and then play for an attack against the white King on the weakened light squares. In addition, this sets up a diabolical trap if white tries to recycle his a4-Knight to b2. For example, 24. Nb2 Qf6! 25. Nxd3 Bxd3 26. Qxd3 Ne5! trapping the white Queen.

A good move indeed. Black will refute Nd2 with Re2. This move prevents white from driving away the Rook with Bf3. This is a refute to the refute.
