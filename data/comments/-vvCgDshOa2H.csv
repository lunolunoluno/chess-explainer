1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Nf6 7. N1c3 a6 8. Na3 d5,White tried to stop this move. The white Pawns on e4 and c4 form what is known as the Maroczy Bind or Wall. This wall is supposed to restrain black in the center. Black played this move which sacrifices a Pawn in order to gain greater freedom of movement for his pieces. Is the sacrifice worth it? In this game - yes. In clear retrospect - no.,True

O-O,"White may have missed his best chance for a win by making this natural move. Karpov himself provides us insight into this position, and how to refute the black gambit. Karpov played the following line against GM John vanderWiel in the 1987 SWIFT tournament in Brussels. 12. Be3! Bxe3 13. Qa4+! Nd7 14. Qxb4 Bc5 15. Qe4+ Kf8 16. O-O with advantage for white.",True

He reinforces his extra Pawn on d5 which black could have regained on move 11. How does black refute the loss of material? Watch how black paralyzes white, dominates the center, and gains control of more space. By move 19 white will be tied in knots.",True

Nab1,A natural retreat which avoids the Pawn fork on b4. Kasparov recommends the more active 17. d6! Ra7! (17... b4? 18. Bxa8 Qxa8 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Na4 bxa3 21. Nxc5 Nxc5 22 Qd5! Qxd5 23. Rxd5 Re5 24. Rxe5 fxe5 25. bxa3 makes a better ending for white.) 18. Nd5 with an unclear position.,True

Bh4 b4 19. Na4 Bd6,"Kasparov states in his book Garry Kasparov: New World Chess Champion, A position for which I had aimed in my preparatory analysis! Black has achieved obvious advantage. White scattered his minor pieces about on either flank and are quite unable to coordinate, the placement of the Knights being particularly depressing. But black has the wonderful duo of Bf5 and Nd3 which completely paralyzes all three white major pieces - a very rare occurrence in a practical game!",True

Bh4 b4 19. Na4 Bd6 20. Bg3 Rc8 21. b3 g5 22. Bxd6 Qxd6 23. g3 Nd7,"A very excel lent move. Black is not content to merely capture the d5 Pawn. Instead, he wants to reinforce the d3-Knight with Nd7-e5 and then play for an attack against the white King on the weakened light squares. In addition, this sets up a diabolical trap if white tries to recycle his a4-Knight to b2. For example, 24. Nb2 Qf6! 25. Nxd3 Bxd3 26. Qxd3 Ne5! trapping the white Queen. Believe it or not.",False

This move prevents white from driving away the Rook with Bf3. This is a refute to the refute. Simply stated this move prevents the freeing Nd2.,False
