"There are different types of mistakes a player can make. This isa""psychologica l"" mistake (different than the ""concrete"" mistake).

"White invites the Winawer Variation (3. /\Bb4). Black however opts for the Classical Variation. Gligoric commented that ""Black can not avoid concrete variations which tend to favor White."" Short called this line the ""Boring Variation"" and wrote, ""This variation is suitable for people with masochistic urges.""",True," The comment directly identifies a specific variation and suggests it’s undesirable due to its inherent weaknesses, indicating a flawed assessment of the move’s quality.",1. d4 e6 2. e4 d5 3.

"9. Re1 is pointless. White missed Ne2 with the idea of c3. This would ensure a permanent (possibly winning) advantage in pawn structure. At this point 9/\. cxd4 is stronger.

"With the last two moves White transforms a playable position into one that is almost completely lost. An idea for move 10 is a4. However b3 is utterly bad. The c-pawn is permanently weak and probably undefendable. The ""hole"" created on c3 will be the can opener to pry White's position open. At this point White can probably resign. White has no credible attacking possibilities. The only redeeming quality is that Black is playing a ""virtual"" piece down (the bad Bishop).

"White's wounds are self-inflicted. The Bishops presence in the center was critical. Black should consider the immediate /\Bc5. Principle: always play in the center, if possible!
