"Bg5 certainly looks odd, but as long as it can be exchanged for Nd2 or Bc1 it's fine.

"How many times have we all seen, in books on the middlegame or in annotated GM games, examples of severe weaknesses, such as Pd6, leading to a decisive game result? In this case Black has a bad weakness, but has also exchanged a couple of minor pieces, so that he's not terribly cramped. If Black had another weakness he might lose, but with only the one he's got a decent chance of drawing.",True," The comment offers a relevant analogy and analysis of a potential tactical flaw, suggesting a strategic vulnerability that could lead to a loss.",1. e4 c5 2.

not very adventurous and it doesn't seem so necessary when both Black minor pieces are needed to guard square d5 -- there's no real threat of a Black incursion at g4,True, The comment highlights a lack of strategic depth and suggests the move is unnecessarily passive.,1. e4 c5 2.
