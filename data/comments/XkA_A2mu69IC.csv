Earlier in the event he played the Black side of a Spanish Game against Michael Adams. Perhaps he's versatile or just playing the opening he feels will cause his opponent the most difficulty (a la a former world champion Emanuel Lasker or his countryman GM Vassily Ivanchuk (!) ) .,True,"
The comment correctly evaluates the move as a mistake by suggesting that the player may have chosen the move based on personal comfort rather than sound strategy, which could lead to unnecessary complications.",1. e4 c5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
"This is less common than 4...Nf6 5. Nc3 e5, but it has it's own interesting character. Black avoids an early ...Ng8-f6 to prevent White from developing Bc1-g5 with a pin.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it describes the alternative move Black could have played (4...Nf6 5. Nc3 e5) that would avoid the weakening of the f6 square and prevent White from developing Bc1-g5 with a pin.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
Neo-Sveshnikov or Kalashnikov Variation,False,"

The comment refers to chess openings and variations, rather than explaining the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6"
"Pc4 and Pe4 seem perfect for securing d5 and keeping Pd6 backward, but those pawns also get in the way of Be2 and Qd1, so it's not an advantage without a downside.",True,"

The comment correctly points out the strategic mistake made by the player, highlighting the trade-off between securing d5 and positioning the bishop and queen effectively.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"
"continuing to avoid ...Ng8-f6. In fact, some players use ...Ng8-e7, after ...a7-a6 chases Nb5 away.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests a better move to develop the knight to f6, which would improve the position and control of the center, aligning with standard opening principles.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"
"He's exchanging-off his bad bishop, it's blocked by pawns on dark squares. But, which is better, to trade them and weaken Pd6 or to leave it at e7 and have a bad bishop?",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the potential downside of trading off a blocked bishop, which could lead to weakening the pawn structure and giving the opponent an advantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g5"
"White is weak at d4, so he's not so crazy about exchanging Bc1.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it criticizes White's position rather than pointing out a specific issue with the move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"
"Bg5 certainly looks odd, but as long as it can be exchanged for Nd2 or Bc1 it's fine. White isn't about to go chasing after it with pawns.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it assumes that the move will be exchanged for another piece, which may not always be the case in actual gameplay.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2 Nf6,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
"Be2 is blocked by his pawns, so Nf3 could be more dangerous to Black.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting that Nf3 is a more aggressive piece development option, given that the bishop on Be2 is obstructed by the pawns.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2 Nf6 10. O-O O-O 11. b3 Nd4 12. Nf3 Bxc1 13. Rxc1 Nxf3+,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on f3 with check"
"How many times have we all seen, in books on the middlegame or in annotated GM games, examples of severe weaknesses, such as Pd6, leading to a decisive game result? In this case Black has a bad weakness, but has also exchanged a couple of minor pieces, so that he's not terribly cramped. If Black had another weakness he might lose, but with only the one he's got a decent chance of drawing.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the severe weakness created by the move and discussing the player's chances of drawing.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2 Nf6 10. O-O O-O 11. b3 Nd4 12. Nf3 Bxc1 13. Rxc1 Nxf3+ 14. Bxf3 Be6 15. Qd2 Qc7 16. Rfd1 Rfd8,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to d8"
not very adventurous and it doesn't seem so necessary when both Black minor pieces are needed to guard square d5 -- there's no real threat of a Black incursion at g4,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake of not using one of the Black minor pieces to defend d5, which is necessary due to the potential threat at g4.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2 Nf6 10. O-O O-O 11. b3 Nd4 12. Nf3 Bxc1 13. Rxc1 Nxf3+ 14. Bxf3 Be6 15. Qd2 Qc7 16. Rfd1 Rfd8 17. h3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"
Ponomariov shows he won't be suckered away from guarding square d5 and prepares ...b7-b5 to completely break the central bind.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7. Be2 a6 8. N5c3 Bg5 9. Nd2 Nf6 10. O-O O-O 11. b3 Nd4 12. Nf3 Bxc1 13.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to a5"
"Anand didn't play horribly, but he certainly missed one big opportunity with 17. Nd5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as Anand failed to capitalize on a significant opportunity by not playing 17. Nd5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Be7 7.
