"In this position Black can exert no pressure on White's centre; his pieces - especially the Rook and Knight on the Rook files - are very poorly placed. To justify the position of Rh5, Black will have to attempt a direct attack on White's King, but this is problematic as White's central dominance allows him to maneuver his pieces rapidly, whether for attack or defence of any threatened sector.",True," The comment identifies a strategic flaw in Black's planning, suggesting a weak center and a lack of effective piece placement, indicating a mistake.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Nf6 3.
