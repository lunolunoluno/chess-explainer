Keres has chosen a line which Reshevsky played against Botvinnik at Nottingham and his plan should be to attack the c-pawn with hisb-pawn,True,", The comment suggests a strategic plan for Reshevsky, potentially indicating a flawed tactical assessment.",1. d4 e6 2.

"This simple move crosses White's plan ... now Rb1 is only a loss of time. It is worth noticing that in the Najdorf-Gligoric game, this recapture with the c-pawn would have been less good, since the Queen Knight was already on d7. In the present game, this piece now has the better square c5, at its disposal",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake by referencing a specific game and highlighting a potential improvement in the recapture, suggesting the current move is less effective.",1. d4 e6 2.

"The endgame will not be favourable for White, even though his Bishop is on the right colour. In fact, this Bishop will find nothing better to do than exchange itself for Black's bad Bishop. Meanwhile Black's microscopic Queensdie advantage (Rooks already half doubled on the c-file, and a small weakness produced by Pa3) will be very slowly brought to fruition",True," The comment describes a logical flaw in the player's assessment of the endgame, suggesting a missed opportunity for a better position.",1. d4 e6 2.
