"Wow! This is interesting. None of the top GMs plays anything this provocative. It is, of course, played by many people at all levels of chess, except at the top. Why does Ivanchuk choose it for this game? One possibility is that he saw Vallejo Pons playing rather solid positions and ""offered"" a possibility of something more unbalanced and tactical.",True," The comment offers a plausible explanation for the move's perceived lack of sophistication, suggesting a tactical consideration.",1. e4 Nf6,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Ivanchuk, Vassily (as Black).

"And already White flinches from the main contest (2. e5) . With this I suspect both players are on their own (out of book) . With Nc3 White isn't able to support a d2-d4 with c2-c3, so f2-f4 is more likely. In that case the game could resemble a King's Gambit more than an Italian or Spanish Game.",True," The comment accurately identifies a potential weakening of White's position and suggests a more aggressive, tactical approach, indicating a flawed move.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

"After Black's first-move provocation Vallejo Pons is proceeding very cautiously, perhaps even more than he might normally. Can Ivanchuk play aggressively to exploit that over-caution? How would he go about it? Oftentimes when one player doesn't use pawns much the other can overwhelm him with pawns. But, it depends upon the opening. Too much use of pawns in some openings just leads to difficulties.",True," The comment suggests a possible tactical opportunity for Ivanchuk, indicating a potential flaw in Black's cautiousness.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

"After this it's quite possible Black will aim for ...Bh3 to trade-off Bg2, thereby weakening all the light squares on the king-side.

"By defending Pe4 White is now free to play Nc3-a4xc5. This would get rid of the bishop, but at the cost of opening the d-file for Black.

Ivanchuk clearly wants to keep Bc5 to keep control of d4 and perhaps to have a piece which reaches all the way to f2 (or g1) to threaten White's king.

"The king-side seems the natural place for active play (for both White or Black) , so removing the king to the queen-side, where it's adequately defended by Bc5 and Nc6, should be safer and enables freer offensive actions on the king-side.",True," The comment suggests a defensive move, potentially hindering offensive opportunities, which is a significant flaw in the original move.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

"idea: to give Bh4 a retreat square and possibly to break up Black's king-side (with g4-g5) when White has both bishops in that area of the board (for both offensive and defensive uses) , but Black has Bc5 stuck on the other side of the board",True," The comment suggests a problematic plan to disrupt Black's king safety, indicating a flawed strategic approach.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

At this point both sides have negated the other's primary advantages.

"At first glance I thought this game was ""remarkably equal throughout"", but upon further study I realized there was a gradual shift to Black in the opening, then back to White in the middle-game and with Black's queen-side action (which White apparently didn't handle properly) the balance was restored.
