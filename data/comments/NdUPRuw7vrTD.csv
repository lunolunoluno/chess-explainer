"Mednis is more a of positional player than a tactical player, so it is not so surprising that he should choose this continuation over the more aggressive 8.g4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights Mednis's positional style preference, suggesting that the move was a natural choice for him despite being tactically inferior.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a4"
Intending Bc8-b7 to pressure White's e4-pawn.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake as an attempt to pressure White's pawn on e4, which indicates the comment likely explains the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b6"
If 9.0-0 then 9...Bb7 and White must play 10.f3 after which Black can choose between 10...d5 or 10...Rc8.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it refers to a hypothetical move (9.0-0) rather than the mistake that occurred.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"
With a view to sacrificing the Exchange on c3. The solid 10...Be7 is also possible.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, suggesting a better alternative move (10...Be7) that maintains solid pawn structure.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c8"
"A thematic Sicilian Exchange sacrifice - removing a key defender of the e4-pawn. The line 11...Qc7? 12.Qe1 Be7 13.Rd1 0-0 14.g4! with a clear advantage for White is given by Mednis and Byrne in Informant, but I would never play such an inferior variation as this. In a game against Tal, I chose the possibly superior 11...Be7 12.e5 Bxf3 13.Qxf3 dxe5 14.Nc6 Qc7 15.Nxe7 Kxe7, with an unclear position, and Black went on to win, Tal-Browne, Milan 1975. Coverage of the Tal game is to be found on my forthcoming video ""Beating the Soviet Champions. """,False,"

The comment does not correctly evaluate the mistake made by the player, as the player opted for a more solid move (11...Be7) instead of the suggested Sicilian Exchange sacrifice, which is considered inferior by the commentator.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on c3"
"Black's compensation for the sacrificed Exchange includes the capture of White's valuable e-pawn, play against White's fractured queenside pawn structure and good prospects for his minor pieces.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only discusses the potential benefits of Black's position after the sacrifice, rather than addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e4"
"Passive. Probably better is 13.c4. Note that 13.f5 e5 14.Ne2 Qc7 is promising for Black. After 13.Bxe4 Bxe4 14.Nf3 Be7 15.Nd2 Bb7, I would be very happy, as my bishop is even stronger here than in the main line.",False,"

The comment explains that the move was passive and suggests a better move, but it does not directly address the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
"White's queen is not well placed here. The Black knight covers g3, and after Bf8-e7 the h4 square is also covered. There appears to be little point to this move if Qe1-g3 or Qe1-Qh4 are not possible. Black has good control of center, sufficient material , and good prospects in the center. If 14.Qd4 (eyeing my pawn on b6), then 14...e5 15.Qd3 Ndc5 16.Qc4 d5 17.Qa2 (if 17.Qb4 a5) and the White queen has been on a road to nowhere.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move Qe1-g3, explaining why it's not a good move due to the Black knight covering g3 and the possibility for Black to control the center with good prospects.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e1"
"Increasing my grip on the center, but it was also possible to play simply with 14...Be7.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it points out a missed opportunity to develop the knight to a more active square instead of the less optimal move 14...Be7.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"
"If 15.Bxe4 dxe4, and Black intends a6-a5 and an exchange of dark squared bishops followed by Nd7-c5 and targeting the weak a4-pawn (with Bb7-c6).",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights the immediate tactical threats after the move, including the potential weaknesses Black could exploit, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d4"
If 16.Bxc5 Qxc5+ followed by Nd7-f6 with a great game for Black.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a completely different sequence of moves that would not necessarily follow from the original move made.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g3"
Of course not 16...Qxf4?? 17.Bxe4 losing a piece for Black.,True,"

The comment accurately points out that Black is missing a piece (the queen) due to a blunder in the move 16...Qxf4??.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
If 17.Nxe4 dxe4 and Black is much better.,True,"

The comment indicates that the move 17.Nxe4 was a mistake because it allows Black to play dxe4, strengthening Black's position and offering better chances for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e3"
"Denying Black's Nd7 a route to c4. After 19.Bxe4 dxe4 and the Black's two pawns hold White's three on the queenside, and Black has a dangerous mobile 5-3 majority on the kingside.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it highlights the potential problems White faces after the move, including the loss of material and the creation of a dangerous pawn majority.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a5"
A surprising break in the center which threatens 20...exf4 winning a piece and 20.fxe5 is not possible as 20...f4 wins.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it refers to a different move (exf4) than the one played.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
"Not 20.Bxe4? dxe4 21.fxe5 Qxe5 22.Qf4 Qxf4 23.Rxf4 g6 24.Rd1 (or 24.Rb1 Bc6, followed by Bc6-b5-c4 and/or Ne5-c6 or Ne5-c4, with a big advantage for Black.) 24...Ne5 with a clear advantage for Black.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it details the consequences of the move, which leads to a clear advantage for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20. Ne2,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
An uncompromising method of maintaining the initiative. Black's wall of pawns on the fourth rank make an impressive sight. A good alternative is 20...d4 21.Qd3 c4.,True,"
This comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it suggests an alternative that would challenge Black's pawn structure and potentially create better positional play.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20. Ne2 g5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
Instead 21.Bxe4 gxf4 22.Bxd5+ Bxd5 23.Qd3 was necessary (as pointed out by Byrne and Mednis) although Black is still a lot better. Nor does 21.g3 gxf4 22.gxf4 Kh8 (with the idea Rf8-g8) 23.Kh1 d4 look very good for White.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the sequence of moves that leads to a disadvantageous position for White, referencing authoritative sources for validation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20. Ne2 g5 21. fxe5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on e5"
If 22.Qd3 Nxe5 with the idea of Nc4-e3.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as 22.Qd3 allows Black to take the white queen with Nxe5, exploiting the pin on the e-file.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20. Ne2 g5 21. fxe5 f4 22. Qc1,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c1"
"Let's take stock. White's Ne2 has nowhere to go. White's Bf3 can take on e4, but d5xe4 would give Black a dangerous four on two majority with possibilities of e4-e3 (followed by Qc7-c6) or f4-f3 coming.",True,"

The comment accurately evaluates the mistake made by highlighting the strategic positioning and potential threats White faces after the move Ne2.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20. Ne2 g5 21. fxe5 f4 22. Qc1 Nxe5,"This is a game between Mednis, E (as White) and Browne, W (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e5"
Guarding the b6 entry point and eliminating White's only possible counterplay. Black's powerfully posted knights are vastly superior to White's passive rooks.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the strategic weakness by allowing White to create counterplay through the b6 entry point, which was not adequately guarded.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18.

Black wins back the Exchange securing a material advantage and a clearly winning game.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the exchange of rooks resulted in Black gaining a material advantage, which indicates a clear winning position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18.

Last move played: White plays Queen takes on b1"
"Also good is 26...Ne3, with the idea g5-g4.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it suggests an alternative, better move rather than analyzing the error in the previous move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. a5 e5 20.

"Desperate times lead to desperate measures. I was about to ice the game with Nd2xf3+, so Mednis resorted to this petite combination that ultimately backfires.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, as it explains resorting to a risky move (Nd2xf3+) due to desperation, which ultimately resulted in a suboptimal outcome.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18.

Refuting Edmar's last hopes.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player but rather refers to the opposing player's state of hope or confidence.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7.

The long diagonal is completely opened with fatal consequences for White.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates that the long diagonal has been opened, exposing important pieces or pawns, leading to potential disadvantageous situations for White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. Be3 e6 8. a4 b6 9. f4 Bb7 10. Bf3 Rc8 11. O-O Rxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 13. Ne2 Qc7 14. Qe1 d5 15. Bd4 Bc5 16. Ng3 f5 17. Qe3 O-O 18.

"Black is completely winning, but because I was short on time (about 30 seconds left) Mednis played on to the time control at move 40. As we shall see, the threat of g4-g3 is devastating and I require only a few more moves to seal the win. With only a few seconds left on my clock, I missed the simple mate with 33...Qxh4+ 34.Nh3 Qg3 mate.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the missed opportunity for a simple mate that could have led to a quick victory.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

It was necessary to play 37.Qg5 entering a completely losing ending for White.,False,"

The comment is inaccurate as it suggests that moving the queen to g5 would result in a losing endgame for White, which is not necessarily true without considering the entire position.",1. e4 c5 2.
