E49: Nimzo-Indian: Rubinstein: 5 Bd3 d5 6 a3 Bxc3+ 7 bxc3,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the move 7 bxc3 allows Black to gain a significant advantage by winning a pawn after White's bishop captures the captured bishop on c3.",1. d4,"This is a game between Botvinnik, M. (as White) and Capablanca, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
Black gains space.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as gaining space in a chess game does not necessarily indicate a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4,"This is a game between Botvinnik, M. (as White) and Capablanca, J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c4"
The idea is Na6-b8-c6-a5-b3.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely outlines a potential plan rather than addressing the error in play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8,"This is a game between Botvinnik, M.

Prepares a center push with e4.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it actually describes a good move, not a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"
Praise the knight!,False,"

The comment ""Praise the knight!"" does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to be a playful remark rather than a critical analysis of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8 16. Rae1 Nc6 17. Ng3 Na5 18. f3 Nb3,"This is a game between Botvinnik, M. (as White) and Capablanca, J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b3"
Prevents intrusion on f5 and h5.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it vaguely mentions preventing intrusion on specific squares without addressing the strategic or tactical errors of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8 16. Rae1 Nc6 17.

The passed pawn on e6 will quickly become a dangerous weapon.,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player; it refers to a future potential threat rather than addressing the immediate error in the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8 16. Rae1 Nc6 17.

"Having won the Queenside, black is now desperate to bring defensive resources to protect his King. No better is 36... Qxc3+ 37. Kh4 Qe1 38. Kxh5 Qe2+ 39. Kh4 Qe1+ 40. Kh3 Qe3+ 41. g3 h5 (to avoid immediate mate).",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it describes a potential counter-play rather than addressing the initial error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8 16. Rae1 Nc6 17.

Black resigns given that white can force mate in 6 moves.,True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake by stating that the opponent (Black) made a resignation move due to an inevitable checkmate by white in a relatively short number of moves (6), indicating it was a significant blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Ne2 b6 10. O-O Ba6 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 12. Bb2 Qd7 13. a4 Rfe8 14. Qd3 c4 15. Qc2 Nb8 16. Rae1 Nc6 17.
