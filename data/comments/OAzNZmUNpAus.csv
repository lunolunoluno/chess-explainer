Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6
The game has now transposed into a Queen's Gambit Declined. This position could have been arrived at by 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the transposition into a Queen's Gambit Declined, which implies that the player's move deviated from the standard opening sequence of a Queen's Gambit Declined.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4
The exchange variation. White's goal is now to move up his two queenside pawns and exchange them leaving Black with a weak pawn.,True,"

Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5
Pinning the knight and threatening 6. Bxf6 and Black would have to recapture with the pawn because 6... Qxf6 loses to 7. Nxd5.,True,". The comment accurately explains the tactical mistake made by Black, pinning the knight and forcing the pawn to be captured, which would result in a disadvantageous position.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5
Breaking the pin.,False,"

The comment ""Breaking the pin"" does not accurately describe the mistake as it suggests the player successfully disrupted a pin, but the move actually resulted in a loss of material, which indicates a blunder.",1. c4 e6 2.

Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7

White will soon begin attacking on the queenside.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it is predicting the next move rather than analyzing the error in the previous move.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7.

Black will move the knight on d7 to f8 so that the bishop on c8 can be developed.,False,"

Last move played: White plays Rook to c1
Black hopes to simplify by exchanging bishops.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake since exchanging bishops doesn't necessarily imply a poor move; it could be a strategic decision.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7

Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4
So that Black can play 14... Bd6 and the queen will protect the bishop.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out that the move allowed Black to develop their pieces harmoniously, specifically placing the bishop on d6 to aid in the protection of their other pieces.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b6
Preparing for an eventual b4,False,"

The comment does not adequately explain the mistake made by the player as it only suggests a potential future move without explaining the negative consequences of the current move.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to b1
White does not play b4 at once because Black can answer with Nc5 with an equal game.,True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation for the mistake, suggesting that moving the pawn to b4 would allow Black to develop an equal game with Nc5.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1 Bd6 15. Ne2 Ng6 16.

White would have a positional advantage after 18... Qxc5 19. dxc5 Nd7 (Not 19... Nxa4 20. b3 trapping the knight) 20. b4,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it demonstrates why 19... Nd7 is a better move than the knight trade on a4, which would allow White to exploit the pin on the knight after 20. b3.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8.

Qa3,This is a game between Karpov (as White) and Hartinov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to a3
White is going to double rooks on the c file.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it indicates that White is setting up a potential weakness by placing rooks on the same file, which could be exploited by Black.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1 Bd6 15. Ne2 Ng6 16. Bxd6 Qxd6 17. a4 Rac8 18. Qc5 Qb8 19.

White's pieces are much more coordinated than Black's.,True,"

The comment indicates that White's pieces are better coordinated, which usually suggests that Black's move was less effective, potentially making it a mistake.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1 Bd6 15. Ne2 Ng6 16. Bxd6 Qxd6 17. a4 Rac8 18. Qc5 Qb8 19.

"If White can trade this pawn for Black's pawn on a4 and then trade his a pawn for Black's pawn on b7, Black will be left with a weak pawn on c6. This is the plan initiated on move four of the game!",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it describes a tactical plan that capitalizes on the weakness created by the pawn move.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1 Bd6 15. Ne2 Ng6 16. Bxd6 Qxd6 17. a4 Rac8 18. Qc5 Qb8 19.

"Black is beginning a kingside counterattack. In retrospect, it would have been better to simplify the position with 29... Nef5 since the kingside attack never materializes and the h pawn becomes a target.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move was a mistake because it started a kingside counterattack that didn't lead to any advantageous position and left the h pawn exposed.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. O-O Nf8 11. h3 Be6 12. Rfc1 N6d7 13. Bf4 Nb6 14. Rab1 Bd6 15. Ne2 Ng6 16. Bxd6 Qxd6 17. a4 Rac8 18. Qc5 Qb8 19.

If 39... Bd7 40. Bd3 Ng7 41. Ne5 Black is tied up in knots.,True,"

"This is a blunder, probably caused by time pressure.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake as a blunder, which is a strong indication of a poorly evaluated move, and also provides a plausible reason for the mistake (time pressure), suggesting it is a common issue in blunders.",1. c4 e6 2.

and Black resigned. There is no way to prevent the threat of 43. Bxf5 and 44. Nxh4 winning a second pawn. If 42... Ra1+ 43. Kh2 Ra2 then White simply plays 44. Rc2 and the pawn on h4 cannot be saved,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake and the consequences of the move, mentioning the potential for the White bishop to capture the pawn on f5 and the Knight to take on h4, leading to a winning position for White.",1. c4 e6 2.
