"This already bodes badly for my mental state. The point is I didn't play 1. e4 because my opponent does really well with the Caro-Kann. However, this just allows him to reach a Caro anyway and only if he wants to!

"I was supposing that this knight placement wasn't so disastrous because at least 8... Bd6 9. Bf4 looks sort of promising. Sachin played more ambitiously. Actually at the same time I had two feelings. One was that black was probably taking over the initiative and I shouldn't be so delighted. The other was that, well, at least this was not going to resemble our last game where I was desperately trying to find a way to unbalance things to create winning chances. It is definitely possible that black can overplay or underplay his hand now, and the weak kingside will come back to haunt him.",True," The comment highlights a potential strategic miscalculation and a recognition of a risky approach, indicating a flawed evaluation of the position.",1.

"I basically intended to play Be3 and castle queenside, but also hoped that he would spend some time and energy worrying about 12. Bxe6. In fact he played the next two moves instantly, which turned out to be OK but seems a bit risky...
