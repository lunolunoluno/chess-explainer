"Refusing to exchange pieces on black's terms. 9...Ne4 looks silly as white can push through f2-f3, etc. with tempo.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move 9...Ne4 was suboptimal and could have been easily countered by white's tempo moves.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nge2 Re8 9. Qc2 c6 10. h3 Ne4 11. Bf4,"This is a game between Petrosian, Tigran (as White) and Corral, Humberto (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4"," Black's decision to not exchange pieces on White's terms was not advantageous. The move 9...Ne4 does not provide any substantial benefits for Black. Instead, White has the option to push 10. f2-f3, gaining a tempo and improving their position."
Black's N is badly misplaced on h5.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a mistake by pointing out the poor placement of the knight.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nge2 Re8 9.

"It might seem unnatural to exchange queens, since white's main idea is a pawn advanve en masse on the kingside. The main point is to keep the initiative by harrasing black's knight. Meanwhile, white connects rooks and increases his lead in development.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the importance of white's development and initiative, and the downside of exchanging queens prematurely.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Qd2,"This is a game between Petrosian, Tigran (as White) and Corral, Humberto (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"," Black's decision to exchange queens isn't strategic, as White's plan involves a strong pawn advance on the king's side. The key is to maintain pressure by attacking Black's knight. At the same time, White should aim to connect rooks and improve their position."
"g4 is a threat, winning a piece.",False,"

The comment does not correctly explain the mistake because g4 is not a threatening move; it is a weak pawn move that can lead to a vulnerable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5.

"Everything has been well prepared, and besides the obvious 25.fxg6 white also threatens 25.e6 fxe6 26. f6. Black is basically forced to commit suicide by opening the g-file.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the tactical threat white poses on the next move, where black is forced to make a disadvantageous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Black is in a difficult position and must be cautious about how to respond to maintain a stable position."
White has prepared a very nice final blow.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it suggests a potential future action rather than addressing the error in the current move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nge2 Re8 9. Qc2 c6 10. h3 Ne4 11. Bf4 Ndf6 12. f3 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Bd6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. e4 Nh5 16. e5 Qh6 17. Qd2 Qxd2+ 18.
