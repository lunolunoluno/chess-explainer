This came as a surprise.,True,"

The comment implies that the move was unexpected and therefore likely not the best choice, indicating it was a mistake.",1. e4 c5,"This is a game between Ponomariov R., UKR. (as White) and Korchnoi V., SUI. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"," White's move to c5 can be considered surprising, potentially weakening their center control and not adequately challenging their opponent's position."
"Third time with black pieces Korchnoi played f7-f6, but now this move is absolutely correct.",True,"

It appears that the comment is providing a justification for a previously criticized move, indicating that it is now considered correct despite earlier evaluation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

(x Na5),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests the move Na5 was played, which could potentially be a weak move or a blunder if it does not conform to the best strategy or tactics of the current position.",1. e4 c5 2.
