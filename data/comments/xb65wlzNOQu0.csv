"The pawn form ation suggests a Queenside attack by White based on Pb4 and eventually Pc5. Black's plan, on the other hand, should be the advance of ...

"This advance is normally anti-positional since after ... exf4 Black obtains a strong outpost square on e5 and the half-open e-file with which to press on the now backward e-pawn. However, this position is exceptional in that White can ""get away"" with the usually anti-positional advance Pf4. This is because he will obtain strong pressure on the newly opened f-file, whic, in conjunction with the concentration of his minor pieces on or near the Black Kingside, will provide enough pressure to compensate for the aforementioned positional liabilities. In this game Tartakower utilizes these factors well, until a critical moment when he misses a chance for a double exchange sacrifice which would have forced Black to work hard to achieve a draw. Having missed his chance he winds up in a seriously compromised position, which Lasker quickly exploits to his advantage",True," The comment provides a detailed explanation of why the move was considered a mistake, specifically highlighting the positional advantage Black gained and how White exploited it to create a favorable endgame.",1. c4 e5 2. a3 Nf6 3. e3 Be7 4.

"Showing a very fine positional sense. The weakening of e5, consequent to the advance 14. Pf4, has givven Black the chance to occupy the outpost at e5. The purpose of the text move is to prepare to occupy e5 by a coordinated sequence of moves. Incidentally, the text also prevents the possibility of White pushing Pe4-e5",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, though it's somewhat convoluted and potentially misleading.",1. c4 e5 2. a3 Nf6 3. e3 Be7 4.

"After this Black is able to occupy e5 and repulse White's attack. As Tartakower later commented, he and a group of strong Berlin players analyzing this positoin found that a brilliant double exchange sacrifice would have maintained the pressure and force Black to defend resourcefully to hold the game",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic opportunity missed.",1. c4 e5 2. a3 Nf6 3. e3 Be7 4.
