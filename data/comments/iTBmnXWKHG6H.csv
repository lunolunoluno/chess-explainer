"If White strikes first with the advance of his d-pawn, then Black is able to equalize with 8.d4 cxd4 9.Qxd4 Nc6 10.Qd2 d5 11.cxd5 Qxd5, for example 12.Nd4 Ne4! 13.Nxc6 Qxc6 14.Bxg7 Kxg7 15.Qe3 Qc5 16.Qxc5 Nxc5 17.Bxb7 Nxb7 18.Nc3 Rac8 19.Rac1 Rfd8, is completely equal, Barcza-Steiner, Budapest 1948. If we compare this situation to the one that occurs in the line after 8.Nc3 d5, we note that here Black has completed his development and is able to challenge White on the c- and d-files with his rooks.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential for Black to equalize the position and emphasizing the importance of development in the given situations.",1. c4 c5 2.

Black breaks the symmetry of moves and provokes the following flurry of exchanges. In my opinion this move is a little dubious and Black can instead equalize in the variation with 8...Na6!,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move and suggests an alternative, equalizing move for the black player.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8.

"The only correct way to proceed. If 9.cxd5?! Nxd5 10.Na4 Bxb2 11.Nxb2 Nc6, Black has at least equalized as the White knight on b2 is misplaced.",True,"

The comment correctly explains that the move 9.cxd5 was a mistake, leading to a loss of tempo and a weakened position for White. Black's next moves equalize the position and take advantage of the misplaced knight on b2.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on d5"
"The exchanging sequence is forcing, as 11...Bxd5 12.d4, is good for White. Note that White wins immediately after 12...cxd4? 13.Qxd4+ Kg8 14.Rfd1, pinning and winning Black's bishop.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it details why the exchange with 11...Bxd5 followed by 12.d4 is advantageous for White, leading to a win after Black's potential mistake of 12...cxd4.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on d5"
"Black's last opportunity to avoid the endgame that occurs in the game is 12...Na6, when it is probably easier for Black to demonstrate equality.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as Na6 would have avoided the inevitable endgame and potentially given Black a chance to equalize.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black).

"Less effective is 13.Nh4 Qd7 14.Bxb7 Qxb7 15.Qxd4+ Kg8 16.Rfd1 Nc6 17.Qd7 (17.Qe4 Rfd8 18.Nf3 0.5-0.5 Sanguinetti-Panno, Buenos Aires 1977) 17...Qxd7 18.Rxd7 Rfd8 0.5-0.5 Tal-Salov, Brussels 1988. In both cases Black equalized.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it breaks down the sequence of moves and shows how Black managed to equalize in both instances (Sanguinetti-Panno, Buenos Aires 1977 and Tal-Salov, Brussels 1988).",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on d4 with check"
"An important position in the Double Fianchetto Exchange Variation which in practice has been a deceptively tricky defensive chore for Black. White has a small nagging initiative for the endgame in that: a) his knight is ACTIVE and CENTRALIZED, while Black's knight is still at home (indeed, it is not clear where Black should develop his knight); b) White's rooks are already CONNECTED; c) White has the maneuver Nd4-b5 in reserve to create pressure against Black's queenside pawns and interfere with Black's development.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it focuses on the general position and tactics in the Double Fianchetto Exchange variation, rather than pointing out the specific error made in the move.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: White plays King takes on g2"
"Black prevents the possibility of Nc3-b5 and prepares to develop his rook with Ra8-a7 to facilitate doubling of the rooks on the c- or d-file (if allowed). Alternatives include: 15...Nd7, and now: A) 16.Rfd1 Nf6 17.Nb5! Rfc8 18.Rac1 Rxc1 (if 18...a6? 19.Nc7 Rab8 20.Nxa6 Rxc1 21.Rxc1 Ra8 22.Nb4, and White has won a pawn) 19.Rxc1 a6 20.Nd4 Rd8 21.e3 Nd5 22.Rc6 Rd6 23.Rxd6! exd6 24.Kf1, and White enjoys an advantage in the knight endgame thanks to his better pawn structure, Andersson-Marovic, Banja Luka 1976.

These examples show how White's Nd4-b5 idea can make life awkward for Black. An interesting try is 15...Na6!? 16.Rfd1 Rfc8 17.Rac1, and now: A) 17...Kf6 18.Nb5 Rxc1 (18...Nc5? - losing a pawn - 19.b4 Ne6 20.Rxc8 Rxc8 21.Nxa7, with a big advantage for White, Smyslov-Castro Rojas, Biel 1976) 19.Rxc1 Nc5 20.b4 Ne6 21.Rc6, reaches a position that occurred in the game Portisch-Pachman, Sarajevo 1963, when White stood better. B) 17...Nb4 18.Rxc8 (Possible is 18.a3, when White may have a slight pull) 18...Rxc8 19.Rd2 a6 0.5-0.5 Benko-Weinstein, Lone Pine 1975. Also possible is 15...Rc8, when 16.Rac1 Nd7 17.Rfd1 transposes to variations examined after 15...Nd7.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it provides alternative moves that White could have played to capitalize on the mistake and disrupt Black's development and pawn structure.",1. c4 c5 2.

The comment accurately evaluates the mistake by demonstrating alternative moves and explaining why the original move was a mistake.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7.

Last move played: White plays Rook to c1"
White anchors his centralized knight.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because anchoring the knight in the center can be a poor strategy as it might limit the knight's mobility and does not necessarily contribute to controlling key squares or creating threats.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2 a6 16. Rac1 Ra7 17.

"A mistake, as White will be able to capitalize on the resultant weakening of the Black pawn structure. Better is 18...Kf8 19.Rfc1, transposing to the Andersson-Hort game in the previous note, although as we saw, White also enjoys more pleasant prospects in that instance.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake and explains how White can take advantage of the weakened Black pawn structure, providing a deeper understanding of the position.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2 a6 16. Rac1 Ra7 17.

"Passively defending the e-pawn with 19...Re7 can be met with 20.Rfc1 Kf8 21.Rc8, and White stands better.",True,"

The comment correctly points out the weakness of passively defending the e-pawn and suggests a better plan for White to capitalize on the mistake.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2 a6 16. Rac1 Ra7 17. Rc2 Rd8 18. e3 e5 19. Nf3 f6,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f6"
White gains space on the kingside and has a perceptible advantage.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because gaining space on the kingside and having a perceptible advantage does not inherently indicate a mistake; it could be a strategic decision.",1. c4 c5 2.

"An exchange of rooks has exposed Black's tender spots along his third rank (b6, d6).",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as the player's exchange of rooks has left Black's pawns on the third rank vulnerable.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7.

Rxc6,"This is a game between Andersson, U (as White) and Robatsch (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on c6"
Andersson redirects his knight to the more lucrative outpost on e4.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as moving the knight to e4 is not a typical or strong move, and it suggests that a more strategic outpost would have been preferable.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2 a6 16. Rac1 Ra7 17.

"Keeping the knight out of e4 with 24...f5? allows White to post the knight efficiently elsewhere with 25.gxf5 gxf5 26.Nc4, and Black is losing a pawn, as 26...b5 allows 27.Nd6+ etc.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake in the move f5, which weakens the knight's position and allows White to gain a pawn and a strong central presence.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. d4 cxd4 13. Qxd4+ Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxg2 15. Kxg2 a6 16. Rac1 Ra7 17. Rc2 Rd8 18. e3 e5 19.

Effectively binding Black's position.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player as it does not mention the specific move or its consequences, but rather describes a potential outcome of a different move.",1. c4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to b4"
Andersson now directs his knight to the more powerful post on d5.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake as Andersson's knight ends up on a more powerful square (d5).",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O g6 6. b3 Bg7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Nc3 d5 9.

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, pointing out the move that forces Black into a losing position with limited options and highlighting the potential for White to gain material advantage.",1. c4 c5 2.

"White's king penetrates easily after this move by Black. But even after 29...fxg4 30.Kxg4, there is a grim defensive task for Black.",True,"

Andersson introduces his king as the last attacking unit in his endgame attack. Black's kingside pawns have become easy targets.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by Andersson, as introducing the king early in an endgame without proper support puts the king at risk of being attacked, especially when the opponent's kingside pawns are weakened.",1. c4 c5 2.
