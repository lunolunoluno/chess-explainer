"If White strikes first with the advance of his d-pawn, then Black is able to equalize with 8.d4 cxd4 9.Qxd4 Nc6 10.Qd2 d5 11.cxd5 Qxd5, for example 12.Nd4 Ne4! 13.Nxc6 Qxc6 14.Bxg7 Kxg7 15.Qe3 Qc5 16.Qxc5 Nxc5 17.Bxb7 Nxb7 18.Nc3 Rac8 19.Rac1 Rfd8, is completely equal, Barcza-Steiner, Budapest 1948.

"The only correct way to proceed. If 9.cxd5?! Nxd5 10.Na4 Bxb2 11.Nxb2 Nc6, Black has at least equalized as the White knight on b2 is misplaced.",True,"

If Black moves the King to g8, White can follow up with 14.Rfd1, pinning Black's bishop and securing a winning position."
"Black's last opportunity to avoid the endgame that occurs in the game is 12...Na6, when it is probably easier for Black to demonstrate equality.",True,"

"An important position in the Double Fianchetto Exchange Variation which in practice has been a deceptively tricky defensive chore for Black.

The comment explains the mistake because anchoring the knight in the center can be a poor strategy as it might limit the knight's mobility and does not necessarily contribute to controlling key squares or creating threats.",1. c4 c5 2.

Andersson introduces his king as the last attacking unit in his endgame attack. Black's kingside pawns have become easy targets.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by Andersson, as introducing the king early in an endgame without proper support puts the king at risk of being attacked, especially when the opponent's kingside pawns are weakened.",1. c4 c5 2.

"The continuation might be 33...a5 34.b5 Kf7 (34...Kh7? loses to 35.Rxd7+ Rxd7 36.Nf6+) 35.Kg5, and White wins another pawn. What we learn from a study of a game such as this is that no matter how quiet or simplified a position may appear on the surface, active and accurate defense is paramount as any mistake can lead to a technically lost endgame (with almost certain fatal consequences).",True,"
