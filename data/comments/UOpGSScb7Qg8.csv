E26: Nimzo-Indian: Saemisch: 5...c5 6 e3,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player, as the Nimzo-Indian Defense has arisen, and the move 5...c5 is a typical and strong response, while 6 e3 does not continue the main line of the Nimzo-Indian Defense and is considered a mistake in this position.",1. c4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Gary (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"
The knight intends Nb8-c6-a5-b3,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not clarify what the mistake was or why the move was considered a mistake.",1. c4 e6 2.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
The black knight is well posted.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it praises the positioning of the black knight without addressing the specific error in the move.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Nf6 7. cxd5 exd5 8. f3 c4 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. g4 h6 11. Bg2 Na5 12. O-O Nb3,"This is a game between Kasparov, Gary (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b3"
Threatening mate: Qxh2,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake made by the player, as moving the queen to h2 directly threatens checkmate, which is a blunder in a properly played chess game.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Nf6 7. cxd5 exd5 8. f3 c4 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. g4 h6 11. Bg2 Na5 12. O-O Nb3 13. Ra2 O-O 14. Ng3 Bd7 15. Qe1 Re8 16. e4 dxe4 17. fxe4 Nxg4 18.

This push gains space,False,"

Plans exf6,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only mentions the move ""exf6"" without providing any specific reason or context for why it might be considered a mistake.",1. c4 e6 2.

Demolishes the pawn shield. The mate threat is Qxf7,True,"

White now must not overlook the idea gxh6,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it references an unrelated move (gxh6) which does not assess the current mistake.",1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Nf6 7. cxd5 exd5 8. f3 c4 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. g4 h6 11. Bg2 Na5 12. O-O Nb3 13. Ra2 O-O 14. Ng3 Bd7 15. Qe1 Re8 16. e4 dxe4 17. fxe4 Nxg4 18.

Threatening Ne7,False,"

The comment ""Threatening Ne7"" does not directly address the mistake made by the player as it does not provide specific information about the move's consequences or the error in it.",1. c4 e6 2.
