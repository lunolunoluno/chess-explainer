"I don't recall Ivanchuk previously using this system against Kasparov. His flexibility with openings is shared by some other GMs, but few people truly play many defenses (or openings for White) with equal skill. There is simply too much specialized detail about most openings for this to be possible. Ivanchuk does better than most, but still has an occasional flub, as in the first round game of his FIDE wch match with Ponomariov.",True," The comment highlights a potential weakness in Ivanchuk’s strategic understanding, suggesting a lack of consistent defensive proficiency.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Black's position isn't very enterprising. It's quite passive. He's traded off one minor piece, so his cramp won't be too terrible, but he will have to be in a mood to counter-attack if he's to find any chance to win.",True," The comment offers a subjective assessment of the position’s strategic value, suggesting a lack of initiative.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Usually one wouldn't consider moving Pb7 when there's a Be2 to target Pa6, but Black has to be able to play ...b7-b6 to prevent c4-c5 and possibly to play ...b7-b5 (or ...b6-b5) to chop into White's central pawns, making more room for Black pieces to maneuver. Naturally White will make this more difficult.",True," The comment offers a possible explanation for the mistake, suggesting Black's strategy to create a strategic advantage.",1. e4 c5 2.

"preventing Bb6-c7xd6 and targeting Pc4. Kasparov isn't gaining much ground and without queens he won't have any king-side attack.

"If White hadn't played Nc3-a4 Black's Nd7 could go to e5, but in this situation Na4-b6 hits Ra8 and guards Pc4.

"It's this kind of move which seems so mysterious. What does it do, except keep the status quo? One obvious offensive idea is to double rooks on the d-file to threaten Pd6, but that's met by ...g7-g5 to chase Bf4 back. I suppose Kasparov just decided it wasn't worth the risk to try any major offensive thrust; so, he'll just wait for the next game and see what develops.",True, The comment provides insight into the player's hesitation and strategic assessment of the move's potential consequences.,1. e4 c5 2.
