"This game was played in the recent UMBC Open tournament. UMBC players tend to despise this event because of the high entry fee and the fact that it is required to be considered for team selection. Nonetheless, there is also a positive aspect to playing basically ""at home"", and I did well this year. My fourth round game was probably the best.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it focuses on the tournament and the player's feelings about it, rather than providing analysis on the chess move.",1. d4,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
"A perfectly well-known system, of course. However, one of my weak points is that I have never really settled on a single main defense against 1.d4, and therefore I was already on somewhat unfamiliar ground. The last time I had faced this move was almost a year ago against Ilye Figler, when I got crushed. However, even after that game I had not prepared fully.",True,"

The player's comment indicates that their unfamiliarity with the opponent's 1.d4 opening and their lack of preparation for the specific variation they played contribute to their mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
"Bengston mentioned after the game that this line is out of fashion, but it was the only one I (sort of) knew.",True,"
The comment indicates that Bengston highlighted the move as outdated, implying it was a mistake, but the player admits to only partially knowing the better move, suggesting the error was due to a lack of familiarity with the current trends.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"
"An ambitious move - also, not to be misleading, the normal move in this position. Anyway the idea is that if black wants to keep the bishop then white will gain valuable tempi for queenside expansion. In the game against Figler I had basically ignored white's idea with 7...O-O; this time I knew basically one more move... by the way, this is not the recommended way to learn theory, one move at a time!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the potential gain in tempo for white and the missed opportunity to simplify the position against the opponent's bishop.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c5"
"This basically just hands white a pleasant position. After I became disillusioned with 9...Nxc3 I didn't see anything else, but the situation actually should not be considered so desperate.",True,"

The comment sufficiently explains the mistake made by the player because the move Nxc3, while not a blunder, allows White to gain a strong position due to the exposed King and lack of development.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on d2"
"This appears to be almost the only way for black to play. The idea is to play 12...bc and to gain the c6-square if white re-captures with the b-pawn. If white takes with the d-pawn, as in the game, then black gets a central majority.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake by pointing out the strategic intention behind the move, as well as the potential advantages and drawbacks of different responses from the opponent.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b6"
"The ambitious decision, which was easy to predict. My opponent outrated me by about 200 points and so far he has every indication that things will go his way. After all, I have taken a long time to play moves which are inferior to established theory. Nonetheless 13.bc was worth a thought.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player failed to recognize their opponent's superior positioning and underestimated their opponent's strategic advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11.

"This was the crux of my idea, and it seems to be the best try. The knight goes to e7 so it can support the center.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely states the intended purpose of the move without indicating any issues or errors.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"Of course nothing could be more natural, and I was counting on this. Nonetheless, 14.Rb1 should be considered for reasons that I will explain in a moment.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not provide any specific reasoning or analysis regarding the poor move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b5"
"The obvious idea is ...e5, but there is another threat that white has so generously helped me to create with his last move...",True,"

The comment indicates that the player failed to see a more significant threat posed by the opponent's last move, mistakenly believing...e5 to be the only option.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11.

"After the game white explained that he had been relying on this move, which attempts to break apart my center. Now enormous complications erupt.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player as it addresses the impact of the move on disrupting the opponent's center control, leading to complex complications in the game.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"
"I apologize for giving myself three exclams in a row... the idea isn't quite that brilliant, and I am not even certain if it is sound. However, each move is an integral part of black's plan. If I didn't have 18...Qb6 I wouldn't be able to gain the necessary tempo to protect d4 so I can push in the center, and the center would collapse.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake made by the player, describing the position's dynamics and the necessity of the move for black's plan.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6"
"This move definitely keeps the position from growing stale! Seriously, the next few moves are highly critical - will black's center collapse or will he be able to make something of it?",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because it seems to be expressing concern over the future implications of the move rather than directly addressing the error made in the current move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20. Nd6 e4 21. g4,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g4"
Apparently forced.,False,"

This comment suggests the move was forced, implying it was necessary to make, but does not explain the actual mistake made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

"This is the most active square for the queen. It is true that it allows 22...Nxc6, but then the queen can retreat and everything hangs. It appears that ultimately this doesn't work, but I admit that I have not had time to analyse this position completely, as it is clearly rich with possibilities.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the active square for the queen but also highlights the potential complications and risks of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20. Nd6 e4 21. g4 e3 22. Qb4,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to b4"
Forced.,True,"

The comment ""Forced"" implies that the move was a necessary action due to the opponent's position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9.

Qa3 d3,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d3"
"There are three main ideas behind my sack. First, the pawns are going to try to net at least a rook. Second, ...Nc2xa1 can pick up a stray exchange with tempo. Finally, as Tal said once, white can only take one piece at a time. However, these reasons are just some attempt to make conceptual sense of a random looking position. If you really want to know what's going on, then the variations must speak for themselves, and it turns out that there was a better move.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by identifying potential strategic goals, referencing notable chess player and theory, and concluding that the move played was suboptimal based on the analysis of variations.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

"This is the position I had anticipated with 24...Nd4, and I thought it should be fine because white's king is weak. In the game white even gets into a bit of trouble.",True,"

The comment clearly explains the mistake made by the player by stating that they anticipated the move and believed the white king's weakness would lead to trouble for white.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

Qxd3 Rd8,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to d8"
"An important move in any case, so this seems a good moment to get it in.",False,"

The annotation comment doesn't address the mistake made; instead, it seems to justify a seemingly good move without evaluating its quality or consequences.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20. Nd6 e4 21. g4 e3 22.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
"Possibly the next two moves are too time-consuming... in any case white soon gets into trouble. 31.Rg1 might be better although, frankly, I prefer black here.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out potential issues with both their move and the consequences of it, suggesting a better alternative move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

"A sorry move, although my opponent explained that he had simply missed 34...Qd5. However it isn't clear that he had better.",True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it acknowledges the player's error and also provides reasoning for the opponent's move, although it questions the superiority of the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

This is what Bengston had missed. Now I had an excellent chance to win the game.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it identifies the overlooked opportunity that could have significantly improved the player's chances of winning the game.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

After 35...g6 I probably could have won the endgame.,True,"

The comment accurately reflects the mistake made by the player, suggesting that there was an opportunity to win in the endgame that was overlooked.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5.

"Again 36... g6 was correct. This move is somewhat inexplicable in that now 36... g6 seems more or less obvious to me. However, during the game I became distracted analysing what happens after 36... g6 if I go for the a-pawn instead of the f-pawn, when things are less clear. I guess I didn't appreciate the full range of possibilities. Now the position can even become dangerous to black because white's king is more active. The finish is played at a low level and it's a shame for such a full-blooded middle game to end as this does.",True,"

The comment explains that the player did not consider all possible outcomes of their move, leading them to select what they thought was the best option at the time, but later regretted it after realizing the full range of possibilities.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

"This line is at best barely drawing. My only excuse is that I couldn't belive I was in any trouble after the nice play earlier, i.e., I thought I should be fine through inertia.",True,"

The comment explains that the player was overconfident due to a previous good move and failed to accurately assess their current situation, leading to a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. Ne2 cxd4 6. exd4 d5 7. c5 Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Nxc3 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6 12. b4 bxc5 13. dxc5 Nc6 14. b5 Ne7 15. O-O e5 16. f4 Qc7 17. c6 d4 18. Ne4 Qb6 19. Kh1 Bf5 20.

"I was just starting to appreciate how precarious my position was when this move appeared on the board. Instead, after 44. f5 white could have made me sweat. Although I don't see a win, neither do I see a clear way for black to a draw.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the player's mistake in the move 44. f5, which weakened their position and potentially put them at a disadvantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5.

"And white accepted the draw. All in all, neither of us probably deserved less... or more.",True,"
