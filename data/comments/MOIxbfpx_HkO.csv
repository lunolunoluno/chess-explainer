"This game was played in the recent UMBC Open tournament. UMBC players tend to despise this event because of the high entry fee and the fact that it is required to be considered for team selection. Nonetheless, there is also a positive aspect to playing basically ""at home"", and I did well this year. My fourth round game was probably the best.",True," The comment offers a potential justification for the mistake, suggesting a positive aspect despite the negative perception of the tournament.",1. d4,"This is a game between Bengston, Matt (as White) and Hartwig, Thomas (as Black).

"An ambitious move - also, not to be misleading, the normal move in this position.

"This game was played in the recent UMBC Open tournament. UMBC players tend to despise this event because of the high entry fee and the fact that it is required to be considered for team selection.

"A perfectly well-known system, of course.
