"At this point in the tournament Shirov has drawn with everyone but Adams and has beaten Ivanchuk (3rd-5th place finish) , but lost (with Black) to Anand, Adams and Vallejo Pons (3rd-5th and 6th place finishers) . This is an odd sort of result except that each and every one of these contestants is very strong. One gets the sense Shirov is trying to figure out how to beat the top players and this tournament was (for Shirov) as much for experimentation as anything; or maybe he's just in a bit of a slump.",True," The comment provides context about Shirov's potential strategy and suggests a desire to experiment, indicating a potential mistake.",1. e4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black).

"I don't recall ever seeing Kasparov play this. And, why would he play such a double-edged opening when all he needs is a draw to win the tournament. He risks a lot with this choice because a loss here and a win by Ponomariov would give Ponomariov a tie for first with Kasparov.",True," The comment highlights a potential tactical flaw and the risk involved, suggesting the move was poor despite the perceived draw advantage.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This isn't unknown, but it is uncommon. There aren't so many players who wish to enter into a tactical melee this quickly. The strategic idea is that White's bishop isn't very good and this way it gives it's life to make Na3 very good and to open some lines to Ke8, so it will never find a safe haven.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the move’s weakness, suggesting a strategic deficiency, but lacks concrete analysis.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Black enters the attack vs. counterattack situation and makes room at d8 for Black's king to move around a bit.

"I like this move. It makes Rf1 active and opens the second rank, so White can defend Pg2 more easily. Besides, there's no rule only Black can play on the king-side. Black's pawns block the center pretty well, so play on either or both wings is mandatory.",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting an advantage for Black and highlighting the strategic implications of the move.",1. e4 c5 2.

"If you'd shown me this game without telling me who was playing I might have guessed Shirov, as he plays this Bxb5 variation occasionally, but I'd never have guessed Kasparov would play this variation.

"Black pieces are perfect for offense at d2 and along the d-file AND he defends Kd8 and against the advance of Pa5 very well. White has no hope.
