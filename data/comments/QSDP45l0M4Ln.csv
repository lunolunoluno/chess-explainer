E81: King's Indian: Saemisch: 6th move deviations (including 6 Be3 c6),True,"

The comment appropriately identifies the specific opening variation (King's Indian Defense) and the deviation from the expected move, implying that the player made a mistake by not following the principles of the Saemisch variation.",1. d4,"This is a game between Portisch, Lajos (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4", 'Portisch plays 6th move as Saemisch variation in the King's Indian: deviation from the typical 6th move with Be3 is less common and can lead to a less solid structure.'
