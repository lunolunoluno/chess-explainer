"A bad move which is completely understandable. If we go back a diagram or two, it is easy for Black to get caught up in the euphoria of the moment. Veselin was undoubtedly thinking, that somewhere, somehow, Garry has gone wrong. Perhaps it was that Knight trek to the a5-square? Who cares, I like my position! White is obviously desperate and is sacrificing material. Based on his belief that he was playing from a position of strength, Topalov took the Rook.

"In the apt words of IM Nikolay Minev, ""If Black is going to die, he will die with a full stomach!"" It's interesting to ask if either Kasparov or Topalov saw the move 30.Be6(!!)? I suspect that Topalov only realized that 26...Qc5 27.Qxf6+ Qd6 28.Qd4+ gave White at least a repetition and he wasn't about to let Kasparov off the hook!

"Okay, so far it was easy to calculate. Black's King has been driven up the board and is securely locked in. But what's going on? The extra Rook and Knight are certainly nice for Black.

"(?!) A natural move or an inaccuracy? It depends on your point of view. According to GM Lubomir Kavalek in his column from the Washington Post, the text is dubious and nearly allows Topalov to escape. Immortality could have been had as follows, I quote Lubosh: ""Kasparov is usually very good at weaving mating nets, but he loses the golden thread here. The most elegant and efficient way to finish the game starts with the subtle combining mating threats on the a-file and on the square b3."" According to Kavalek, Black has three defenses: A) 28...Nxd5, B) 28...Bxd5 and C) 28...Bb7 all of which fail. While the above is a fine piece of analysis it turns out that the move Kasparov chose was also winning, so any criticism is misplaced as we'll see.",True," The comment provides a specific analysis of the move's potential impact, suggesting a critical flaw in Kasparov's choice.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

"(?) Once more, according to GM Kavalek, this is where Topalov goes astray. He could have punished White's inaccurate twenty-eighth move [28.Qc3(?!)]. The inescapable conclusion seems to be that Topalov's 30...Qc4 is a bad move, not because he missed a save with 30...Rhe8, rather its a bad move because 30...Rhe8 can only be overcome with extraordinary skill. This analysis was discovered only after a few hundred man and silicon hours were spent on this position!",True," The comment provides a detailed analysis of why Topalov's move was considered a mistake, highlighting the potential for a strong counter-attack and the difficulty of overcoming it.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
