"So many words have been written about Tal that my own observations are perhaps rather superfluous. The brilliance of his play and the dramatic way his wins are often achieved are apparent to all. For tonight's session, and with their instructional content in mind, I would just like to add that it was interesting to me how some of his most striking wins are introduced by apprently simple means - not striving for complications but building up with classically good moves. This may be partly a reflection of how familiar the GM play of the 1950s is to a club player of the 1990s - the Modern Benoni was by no means a staple when Tal played it - but nonetheless you feel that Capablanca would have chosen many of Tal's moves, even if he would have tried to reach a decision by different means. Most curious. It is not unusual to develop one or other Knight to the second rank, but both at once, and before developing either Bishop, is very odd. Any advantage Walther saw in getting Tal out of the books is outweighed by the unnatural formation and the need to get his pieces untangled. Tal does not strike immediately, but develops quietly, waiting for a suitable moment to arise.",True," The comment offers a nuanced perspective on Tal's strategic approach, suggesting the player’s analysis was potentially overly focused on specific tactical elements and missed the broader strategic implications of his play.",1. e4 c5 2.

"White is trying to get sorted but is a long way from castling.

"On ""body count"" Black is a bare Pawn up, but as Bill Hartston says, its the pieces on the board that count, and White's are horribly uncoordinated.",True," The comment highlights a misunderstanding of the significance of piece value, suggesting the focus should be on the board position rather than simply the number of pawns.",1. e4 c5 2.
