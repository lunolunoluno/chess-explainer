1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Nxe4 f5,"This is a mistake. This weakens black's king (the e8-h5
diagonal is now open), doesn't develop, and not black is unable to boot a
white piece from e5. He will have to use pieces now to do that. Instead,
simple development like ...Nf6 or ...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is to be
recommended.",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Nxe4 f5 5. Bg5,"I understand your wish to post a knight on c5, but this
move is dubious. By far, the e5 square is a better outpost. It is a hole in
your opponent's position. A hole is a square that your opponent's pawns can't
cover. c5, on the other hand, can easily be covered by the black b-pawn.
Instead of Bg5, I recommend the following setup to take advantage of black's
weakening by f5: Nc3, Bc4, Nf3, castles short (O-O), and Re1, with a definite
advantage to white because b lack's e6 pawn is a target.",True

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Nxe4 f5 5. Bg5 Be7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. Nc5 Nc6 8. d5,"A good rule of thumb to follow is:
don't attack until you've gotten all your knights & bishops out, and you've
castled to safety! Your entire army wants to get involved in the fight. If you
use just a few pieces, you can be overwhelmed if you opponent uses all of his
pieces, kind of like a 3 on 1 fast break in basketball. Instead, Be2 looks
best, so that if black tries to push ...e5, white won't have to worry about a
discovered check, because the bishop would be blocking. After the text, black
could win a pawn by playing 8. ... Qxc5 9. dxc6 Qxc6.",True

good. Black is threatening ...Qxc5. White MUST prevent the loss of a piece.
Qe2! does the job! Black can't take the knight since that would expose his
king to check by the white queen on e2, which is illegal. White only loses a
pawn this way. Also, the knight on e2 block's white's bishop from getting out.
This will cause problems later. White's king-knight should be posted on f3
instead, where it helps to control the center.",True

piece on c5. Nb3, followed by 11. Qd2 (trying to castle-queenside and thereby
free white's e2 knight to move) is the best way to proceed. 10. Qxd5 is
possible, but black can get a lot of tempo (extra moves) on white, so it's
probably not worth it. For example, 10. Qxd5 Nf6 11. Qc4 O-O-O, and now white
can't even castle",True

White's queen is in jeapordy, and his king is in check. Is there any move that
will get the queen out of danger, AND block the check? Yes! Qe2! Not only that,
it even indirectly defends white's knight at c5, since the black queen is
pinned to her king. Instead, black procures a large amount of material.",True
