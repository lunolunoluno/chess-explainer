"The consequences of this move are hardly calculable over the board. This is not so much a combination but as a genuine sacrifice. The definitie aspect of a combination is the fact that all the variations can be concretely visualized; a real sacrifice on the other hand is to a large extent based on general considerations. In addition to precise calculation, feeling for the position now plays an important part. In the present instance it seems that White has calculated only that he was certain to win a second pawn on h6. For the rest, it was a matter of instinct",True," The comment highlights a lack of precise calculation and reliance on intuition, suggesting a significant flaw in the player's approach.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"The issue is already beyond doubt. White has regained his sacrificed material, and meanwhile the Black King's defences have been utterly destroyed",True," The comment suggests the move was a mistake based on a perceived recovery of material, which contradicts the nature of a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
