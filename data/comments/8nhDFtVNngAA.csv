This move hasn't a thing to do with guarding the e5-pawn (that's just a side benefit). The pawn advances to release the c8-Bishop. You'll notice that the c6-Knight is now pinned.

"This is a standard move in the Ruy Lopez. White creates an ""escape hatch"" for the Bishop on c2. If Black now plays ...b5 and ...Na5, the Bishop just flees to c2.
