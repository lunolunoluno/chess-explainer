"Interesting idea to play 4.d4. Bb5 and Bc4 are also possible here. Black heads into the ""Little Center."" Several idea to attack this center would be to get in f5, Bxe6, Nxe6, Nd5. The move e5 can also be disruptive to the Black center. Another common idea for attacking this set up is to play c4. There are two essential elements here. First, prevent Black from freeing himself with ...d5. Second, play the KB to the a2 - g8 diagonal (Bobby Fischer). This opportunistic diagonal has paid rich rewards to many players. Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White tends to attack on the Kingside, while Black aims at the Queenside. Control these and win. Black meanwhile wants to pressure the pawn at e4 (and support ...d5). Black's main strategy tends to be to head to the endgame as soon as possible (the pawn structure favors Black in the endgame).

"Ouch. A common idea after the g and h pawns have vanished is to get a Rook to the one of the files. The ""perfect"" move is to play 20. Rd3. After this I don't think that Black can defend himself.

"Your strength, in this game, is a strong positional feel that is rare in young players. You seem to have two weaknesses. First, you do not demonstrate a willingness to attack, even though you had positional justification. This tends to come from lack of experience and lack of knowing basic attacking motifs. Second, you don't seem to understand the idea of the opening. (Very few do, in OTB. Play postal and you will learn the ideas very quickly or lose badly, quickly.) I would suggest that you switch to the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on your positional awareness. Work on the common tactical ideas, learn patterns. Maybe one thing that will help you in the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a ""change up"" style (what you pull out for fun or when you've been scouted at a tourney). This will add spice (not to mention confusion) to your opponent's life. If you want to work on your positional understanding, study the games of Karpov - who just happens to be creative attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have never studied his games.) Also read Silman's ""How to Reassess"" book, if you haven't done so already. When all else fails, I'm looking for new students!
