"From doubled pawn, via weak pawn, to backward pawn A radical cure for the weakness of the c-pawn, which however, only transfers the weakness to the d-pawn. This is a back ward pawn of the worst kind. It is the logical result of White's plan of playing all the time against the weakness which began with the doubled pawn. The weakness of a backard pawn consists in the fact that it is fixed and cannot possibly be protected by another pawn. The result in the present case is that White has full control of the central support pointd5",True," The comment provides a detailed analysis of the resulting pawn structure and White's strategic plan, highlighting a weakness that was inadvertently exacerbated.",1. e4 e5 2.
