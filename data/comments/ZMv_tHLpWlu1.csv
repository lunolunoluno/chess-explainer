1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 e6 6. Bf4,"? Definitely
bad. White should try to castle as soon as possible. Also, in the opening,
it's best to develop with attack. 6 Bc4! would be the way to do it (threatens
black's knight at d5). After this, black will get an advantage.",True

Qc7 9. Nf3 f6. Notice white can't take the black pawn on f6 because that would
expose white's queen to attack by the black queen. White's king pawn is what
is called a pin.",True

generally better to capture TOWARD the center of the board. Hence bxc6 is
preferred. In addition, this would give black an excellent post for his queen
bishop on a6. Notice that black's queen bishop doesn't even move this game! If
white does proper defence, this lack of post for thie bishop could've meant a
loss for black.",True

effective. White could've played the correct O-O, and after Rad1, Rfe1, ALL of
his pieces would be active, while black has a hemmed in light-squared bishop.

the bishop pair. Bishops control more squares on an open board. You could

you to remember Peter is to develop ALL of your pieces. You happen to win this
