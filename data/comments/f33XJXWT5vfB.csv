He is a fighter who avoids draws and level positions, and he may have still been striving for a win here. There can be no doubt that 24...Kb6! is superior to what was played in the game. But the move (...Kb6) looks very risky and Topalov may have had a hard time considering that move. It also goes against the natural instinct that good players have to keep your King safe. (The old rule, ""Never let your King go 'a-wandering' with a lot of pieces still on the board,"" is good advice.) (Also Topalov may have still been trying to win.) I should also point out that to see THE WIN, Black would have to calculate nearly TWENTY moves ahead!! I think this might be asking a bit much?
