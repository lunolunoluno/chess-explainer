"Black takes aim at White's center, but this move is risky. With the bishop off the c8-h3 diagonal White can often get an attack going quickly by e4-e5-e6 and jumping in with the rest of his pieces.

"Black hopes to trade pieces to dull White's attack, but this loses time when he can least afford it. 9...dxe5 would have been a better try, though White has a plus after 10.dxe5 Qxd1+ 11.Rxd1 due to space and Black's queenside.",True," The comment offers a potential alternative move and discusses the resulting position, suggesting the player missed an opportunity to improve their attack.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
