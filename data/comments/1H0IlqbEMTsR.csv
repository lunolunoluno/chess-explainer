"Individual opening preparation has, obviously, acquired far too muchimportance for the meeting of chess top players. In order to throw the adversary off his smooth analysis prepared at home, one does not avoid using something that no one expects him to. All through the recent years Topalov played Pirc-Ufimtsev defense only once, in 1997 against Salov in Dos Hermanas.",True," The comment suggests a flawed strategic approach and a reliance on unexpected tactics, indicating a potential mistake.",1. e4 d6,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garry (as White) and Topalov, Veselin (as Black).

"Black has successfully started the opening, and the chances of the opponents were roughly equal when they entered the middle game. Garry Kasparov: ""I did not gain any advantage in the opening.

"As it turned out later, this move shook everyone, including Topalov. Bulgarian grand master thought for a little white and still decided to take the Rook. He will say after the game: ""I calculated the line up to the 30th move, where White, I thought, should have played 30.Qc7, and then a draw with a perpetual check (Qd1-d4 (d5)) should follow"". On some hesitations, Fritz also showed this same line. The audience, having consulted their computers, wondered - Why on Earth does Kasparov aim at a forced draw? Garry Kasparov: ""I saw that White has marvelous opportunities in the line 29.Ra7 Bb7 30.Rxb7. It looked very beautiful: I suddenly saw the geometry of the line and then I decided to capture on d4. While Topalov was thinking over the answer, I calculated all the forced lines to the end and White got a decisive advantage everywhere.""",True," The comment provides a detailed explanation of why the player's move was considered a mistake, citing a calculation and a strategic rationale, suggesting a flawed thought process.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

Now Black can exchange the Queens.

"The Black King has made a long way from a7 to d1 in order to settle finally in the square.

"After the game Kasparov analyzed the refusal to take the Rook on d4: 24...Kb6!? with other participants of the tournament.
