Rather rare move. Main discussions there are now around 10...Qa5,True,"

The comment indicates that the move played (10...) was not well-received and considered uncommon, implying it was a mistake. The subsequent move (Qa5) suggests that the commentator is discussing an alternative strategy, further highlighting the inadequacy of the move in question.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 Be7 8. O-O-O O-O 9. f4 Nxd4 10. Qxd4 a6,"This is a game between Kobalija (as White) and Aseev, Konstantin (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6", White's last move was unusual. The current focus is on whether Black's move to Qa5 was a good decision.
"Early Black automatically played 11...b5, but if White in any case ought to take away his bishop on b3, why Black would not use this tempo for more useful pieses regrouping",True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake by suggesting the use of the tempo gained from the bishop exchange for regrouping, which would have been a more valuable use of the piece.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to c7"," ""White's last move might seem inefficient as Black automatically played 11...b5. However, the move doesn't offer White a direct way to challenge Black's bishop on b3. Instead, Black could have used this moment to regroup their pawns, which might offer a more strategic long-term benefit."""
"An important resource, which allows Black to keep the position",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it praises the move's significance instead of addressing its quality or impact.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 e6 7.
