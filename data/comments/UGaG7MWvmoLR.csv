Weakening c4 and allowing the ensuing play. 14...Bb7 is also nice for white since the bishop has nothing to do there.,True,"

"This little combination opens up the center so white can exploit his positional advantages, particularly on the light squares. Otherwise black would be fine after 16...Ne8.",False,"

Nice. White exchanges off rooks since otherwise black would develop counterplay with ...Rc8-c2 (that was black's idea behind exchanging bishops).,True,"

The extra passed a-pawn wins easily.,True,"
