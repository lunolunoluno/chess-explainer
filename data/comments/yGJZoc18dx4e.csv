"I have to make another observation here. I started playing 6.Bg5 here when I was less than 1400 rated, and my reasons for choosing it had nothing to do with the considerations that might be relavent to me today. However for a very long time I persisted in playing it exclusively, because it became the only line that I knew, and the disparity grew with every game that I played it again. I think that this is a common problem in the way that amateurs choose their opening repertoire.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it provides insight into their decision-making process, showing that their choice of the move was based on habit rather than sound strategic reasons, which contributed to their loss.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5,"This is a game between Hartwig, Thomas (as White) and Carl, Kevin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5"
This turned out to be a very astute choice as I was much better prepared for the main line.,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake as it just states that the player was better prepared for the main line, without revealing what the mistake actually was.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qa5,"This is a game between Hartwig, Thomas (as White) and Carl, Kevin (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a5"
"This fails to even remove the g4-knight, but it does further weaken my dark squares.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the player's mistake as failing to eliminate the opponent's g4-knight and acknowledges the subsequent worsening of the player's position by further weakening the dark squares.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qa5 9. Nb3 Qc7 10. Bd3 Nbd7 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 g5 13. fxg5 Ne5 14. Qe2 Nfg4 15. h3,"This is a game between Hartwig, Thomas (as White) and Carl, Kevin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"
With the idea of Nd2-f3. White appears to have made some progress.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it incorrectly suggests that the move Nd2-f3 was made, while the actual move made by White was Nd2-b3.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qa5 9. Nb3 Qc7 10. Bd3 Nbd7 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 g5 13. fxg5 Ne5 14. Qe2 Nfg4 15. h3 Qb6+ 16. Kh1 hxg5 17. Bg3 Bd7 18. a4 Rc8 19. a5 Qc7 20. Kg1 Nf6 21. Nd2,"This is a game between Hartwig, Thomas (as White) and Carl, Kevin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"
I seriously underestimated the effectiveness of the ensuing pawn structure for black.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that they were not fully aware of the advantages the pawn structure would offer the black pieces in the subsequent game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qa5 9. Nb3 Qc7 10. Bd3 Nbd7 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 g5 13. fxg5 Ne5 14. Qe2 Nfg4 15. h3 Qb6+ 16. Kh1 hxg5 17.

"A last desperate fling? It might have been, except in fact I just missed 31... Re3.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by suggesting that the move was an attempt to salvage a hopeless position, but ultimately, the player missed a better move leading to a better outcome.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qa5 9. Nb3 Qc7 10. Bd3 Nbd7 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 g5 13. fxg5 Ne5 14. Qe2 Nfg4 15. h3 Qb6+ 16. Kh1 hxg5 17.
