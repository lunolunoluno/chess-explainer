"Does Kasparov play like this to avoid the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit or is this the best move order in his opinion to reach a Meran?

"Mig: 'A normal move still in the ""book"" of both players. X3D Fritz has almost three million positions in its library of opening moves and sequences. Kasparov is legendary for his opening preparation and knowledge. He is a walking encyclopedia of opening theory and his opponents have a healthy fear of his surprises in the openings. This move also takes the game away from the game Kasparov won against Deep Junior in this line. That's a sort of psychological advantage, being the first to spring something unexpected. Between two humans it could also be sort of like a game of chicken, with the first player to turn off from the previous game being the chicken.

"Did Kasparov hope for this greedy pawn grab to happen? He gets now a murderous initiative based on his advantage in development, his mighty pair of bishops and the unsafe black king. A human would be shaking in his shoes with Black here. Mig: 'And X3D Fritz takes the pawn! This will give White a lot of pressure against the black position in compensation for the sacrificed pawn. It's ironic that we have the strongest chess computer of all time here and it is playing in the materialistic mode of the first chess programs. In X3D Fritz's opinion, it has enough defensive resources to rebuff Kasparov's initiative. This battle of material vs initiative is what chess is all about. Kasparov gives up a pawn for an attack, but if his attack doesn't succeed then X3D Fritz will have good chances to win with the extra material.
