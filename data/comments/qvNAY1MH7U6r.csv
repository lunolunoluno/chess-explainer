"This game fascinated me for two reasons. For one thing, because black appears to proceed so smoothly towards a completely dominating position around move 30. Usually this indicates a big understanding difference between the opponents, but Beliavsky is a strong GM. What happened?... and this brings us to the second reason. There is one move by black in this game that does not quite fit the ""smooth"" mold; it is absolutely dynamite. If you are using Chessbase Reader to look at this game or something similar, put it into training mode. I will warn you before the move you should try to guess.",True,"

The comment accurately describes two key aspects of the game: Beliavsky's unexpected move and the outstanding mistake made by black, indicating a deep understanding difference between the players.",1. d4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A.

Firstly, 'Black' seemed to advance into a dominant position smoothly around move 30, a situation that typically suggests a significant understanding gap between the players.

"This move-order is used almost exclusively today to avoid the variations with f2-f4. In Portisch's case it would have been a stylistic preference, but one which demonstrated admirable prescience.",True,"

"This is a very typical maneuver in the Benoni before a6, b5, although 9...a6 isn't a mistake. The knight can be well-placed on c7 in conjunction with ...b5, even as a sack. Also, unlike on d7, it doesn't get in the way from that square.",False,"

Also a weird-looking move but you won't even glance twice if you've played through a lot of Benoni games. Playing the knight to c4 puts pressure on d6 and frees the path for the f-pawn.,False,"

"So far I have emphasized that black's play is thematic and typical. This move, on the other hand, is shocking and brilliant. I am not a strong enough player to guaranantee to you the move's objective value, but I can tell you this. Creativity, and keeping your opponent off balance, wins games. Outplaying a strong opponent like Beliavsky as completely as we shall see later is not possible if he can predict all of your moves. So, from a pragmatic point of view, completely sound or not, look for something like this in all of your games, as it can be absolutely devastating.",True,"

This is the point. By corrupting his pawn structure black brings the knight (which was doing nothing on c7) into the game.,True,"

This completely vindicates black's plan. Now he has a good structure back and he has made significant progress. The a-file is open and the formerly useless c7-knight has been exchanged.,True,"

"Black wants to exchange pieces, which breaks down white's blockade and brings him closer to a position where the passed c-pawn is a real trump.",True,"

"And white resigned not a moment too early. As a sort of post-script, I want to add that this game is an interesting lesson about the way opening theory is developed. After I had completed my notes, I got a copy of Ftacnik's notes for the Informator. He basically had two interesting things to say. One was regarding the move 21.Kh1, which he thinks is a mistake. I have to admit that I don't really understand his analysis, as he seems to be assuming that in any case white must play Ba4xb5, which I didn't agree with. The second thing that was really interesting was the suggestion of 19.Be2... What do you think is the idea of that move? That's right, to prevent 19...bxa4! After the brilliant 19...bxa4 has been discovered, somebody finds 19.Be2, invents a logical explanation which is condensed to one sentence (if you're lucky) in the opening monographs to save space, and theory moves on. No wonder it is so hard to understand! The lesson is to look for the games behind the moves, and be reluctant to just accept that one-sentence explanation and be denied the pleasure of discovering what is really, actually going on with 19.Bc2.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player by discussing the move 21.Kh1 and suggesting that it may have been a mistake, while also providing context and analysis for why the move might be considered suboptimal.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Regarding the game's insights, the comments on the move 21.Kh1 are intriguing but a bit unclear. I didn't see the necessity for white to play Ba4xb5 in this situation.

The second point of interest is the move 19.Be2, which appears to aim at preventing Black's bxa4. While this explanation is often condensed in opening monographs, it's essential to delve deeper and understand the game's intricacies beyond the one-sentence summary. The beauty of chess lies in exploring the reasons behind the moves, which can sometimes challenge the conventional wisdom presented in opening literature."
