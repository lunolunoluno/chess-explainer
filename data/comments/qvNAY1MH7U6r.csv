"This game fascinated me for two reasons. For one thing, because black appears to proceed so smoothly towards a completely dominating position around move 30. Usually this indicates a big understanding difference between the opponents, but Beliavsky is a strong GM. What happened?... and this brings us to the second reason. There is one move by black in this game that does not quite fit the ""smooth"" mold; it is absolutely dynamite. If you are using Chessbase Reader to look at this game or something similar, put it into training mode. I will warn you before the move you should try to guess.",True," The comment highlights a potentially significant tactical mismatch, suggesting a missed opportunity.",1. d4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, A.

"This is a very typical maneuver in the Benoni before a6, b5, although 9...a6 isn't a mistake. The knight can be well-placed on c7 in conjunction with ...b5, even as a sack.

Also a weird-looking move but you won't even glance twice if you've played through a lot of Benoni games.

"By the way, all of this, so far as I know, is still playable theory, and it may continue to be so for a few moves although I'm not certain.

"So far I have emphasized that black's play is thematic and typical. This move, on the other hand, is shocking and brilliant. I am not a strong enough player to guaranantee to you the move's objective value, but I can tell you this. Creativity, and keeping your opponent off balance, wins games. Outplaying a strong opponent like Beliavsky as completely as we shall see later is not possible if he can predict all of your moves. So, from a pragmatic point of view, completely sound or not, look for something like this in all of your games, as it can be absolutely devastating.",True," The comment directly addresses the player's perceived lack of skill and highlights the importance of creative and disrupting play, suggesting the move was a significant mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

This completely vindicates black's plan. Now he has a good structure back and he has made significant progress.

"White must co-operate.

"And white resigned not a moment too early. As a sort of post-script, I want to add that this game is an interesting lesson about the way opening theory is developed. After I had completed my notes, I got a copy of Ftacnik's notes for the Informator. He basically had two interesting things to say. One was regarding the move 21.Kh1, which he thinks is a mistake. I have to admit that I don't really understand his analysis, as he seems to be assuming that in any case white must play Ba4xb5, which I didn't agree with. The second thing that was really interesting was the suggestion of 19.Be2... What do you think is the idea of that move? That's right, to prevent 19...bxa4! After the brilliant 19...bxa4 has been discovered, somebody finds 19.Be2, invents a logical explanation which is condensed to one sentence (if you're lucky) in the opening monographs to save space, and theory moves on. No wonder it is so hard to understand! The lesson is to look for the games behind the moves, and be reluctant to just accept that one-sentence explanation and be denied the pleasure of discovering what is really, actually going on with 19.Bc2.",True," The comment offers insightful analysis of a specific opening theory point and suggests a deeper understanding of the game's nuances, potentially pointing to the player’s misjudgment.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
