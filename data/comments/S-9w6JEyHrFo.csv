"If 13. ... Bd4, 14. Rb1 Qa7 (To provide a flight-square for the Bishop.) 15. Nxd4 Qxd4 16. Be3 and black loses his Queen.",True,"

The comment accurately describes a tactical sequence that leads to the loss of the queen for black.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"
Now the Black Pawn on e6 is backward. A black piece will be always tied down to the defence of this Pawn. After this move the activity of Black Bishop on c8 is greatly diminished.,True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake of having a backward pawn on e6, which can weaken the black pawn structure and limit the activity of the black bishop on c8.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
To prevent 19. g4. But this move weakens Black's Pawn structure.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that the move weakens Black's pawn structure, which is a significant drawback in chess strategy.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5"
"Black wants to move his knight from the passive position. But if 20. ...Nd7, Nxf5 exf5 e6+!. But after Black's move all his Pawns are on white squares. So Black has very weak black squares, defended by his Bishop.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the consequences of Black's move, which leads to a weakness in his position with pawns on the backward squares and poor coordination of pieces.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"
"A remarkable Knight tour. The Knight is headed for c6, to remove Black's only defender of his weak dark squares.",False,"

The comment does not address the mistake made, as it praises a hypothetical strategic move rather than providing an analysis of the actual blunder.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to a5"
"Now Steinitz gives a valuable lesson in exploiting square weaknesses, effective use of open file and Rook on the 7th rank.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by highlighting how Steinitz capitalized on the weaknesses, controlled the open file, and placed the Rook on the 7th rank.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to a8"
To prevent penetration to the 7th rank.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as they likely overlooked the importance of controlling the 7th rank, which can be crucial for creating a strategic advantage.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 Bd8,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d8"
Steinitz wants to eliminate Black's only defender of dark squares-the Bishop on d8. For that he allows a chance to exchange his bad Bishop on a8. Now if 27. ...Bxc6 28. Qxc6 Nf8 29. Nxe6! Nxe6 30. Qd7+ Be7 31. Rc6! Nf8 32. Rf6+ and White wins.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake made by the player, as it outlines how Steinitz's move weakens his own position by allowing Black the opportunity to exchange the superior Bishop on d8 for a less valuable Bishop on a8, leading to a tactical advantage for Black.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 Bd8 27. Nac6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c6"
To prevent 31. Bh4.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move that allowed the opponent to play Bxh4, threatening the queen.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 Bd8 27. Nac6 Qb7 28. Nxd8+ Rxd8 29. Qc7 Qb8 30. Bf2 Qb6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6"
"White controls the 7th rank which is Rook, his Knight is headed for g5, and his Bishop controls all the Black squares. Black cannot move his Knight because of the Pin, his Rook is tied down to the defence of the Knight and his Bishop has no safe square. Black must meet the threat of 33. Bh4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the tactical reasons why the black pieces are at a disadvantage and highlights why the white player's move was strong, forcing the black player into a defensive position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 Bd8 27. Nac6 Qb7 28. Nxd8+ Rxd8 29. Qc7 Qb8 30. Bf2 Qb6 31. Nf3 Qxc7 32. Rxc7,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on c7"
To prevent 35. Re7#,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake since it only suggests a possible threat without indicating why the move was a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 Bd8 27. Nac6 Qb7 28. Nxd8+ Rxd8 29. Qc7 Qb8 30. Bf2 Qb6 31. Nf3 Qxc7 32. Rxc7 Ke8 33. Ng5 Nf8 34. Bc5 Nd7,"This is a game between Steinitz, W (as White) and Sellman, A.G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7"
"Black is in zugzwang since all legal moves result in drastic material losses. (a) The King may not move. (b) The Bishop may move only at the risk of being captured. (c) The Rook may move to b8, when 36. Rxd7 Kxd7 37. Bxb8 wins a piece for White. (d) The Knight may move to b6 when 36. Re7+ Kf8 37. Nh7+ Kg8 38. Nf6+ Kf8 39. Rd7#.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the circumstances of zugzwang and the resulting material losses after each possible legal move for Black.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20.
