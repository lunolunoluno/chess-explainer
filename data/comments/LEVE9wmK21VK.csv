"<<An unexpecte d reply, typical of Alekhine! The logical reply would have been 12...Bxf6 and although Black would have been saddled with a backward king pawn, he would have had a tenable position. Bit the great Alekhine was never content with positions in which he had to be on the difensive; he always tried to steer into situations which created complications which might offer him winning chances, even though great risks were involved. The text move exposed Black's King to White's forces, but offered Black counter-maneuvers in the center>>. (Reshevsky)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic deficiency of the move, its potential risks, and the alternatives that could have been more favorable for Black.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

"<<The pawn is immune on account of Bd6-c5. It is clear that White will eventually surrond the advanced Black KP and swallow it, but even then Black will obtain tremendous compensation in the shape of bishop diagonals towards White's king. Incidentally, it is better to preserve the KBP with the text move than to cover c4 with Qe2, allowing Bxf4>>. (K) 20...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the consequences of the move on White's position, specifically the lack of support for the advanced Black King and the potential for Black to gain compensation.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

<<In the interests of containing Black's passed pawn White is obliged to indulge in some unpleasant contortions. Black could have tried e3-e2!? on the previous move >>. (K) 27...,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it points out that White should have played e3-e2 to challenge Black's passed pawn, suggesting a missed opportunity to contain the pawn and gain an advantage.",1. e4 Nf6 2.

"<<Heading for a post on the c6-h1 diagonal, along wich White is notably exposed, with no pawn cover and a variety of poorly preyected pieces which can be pinned to his King.
