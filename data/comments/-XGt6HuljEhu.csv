1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3,"Anderssen first adopted this
move in his match against Morphy, which at the time caused a great deal of
animadversion amongst theorists, who were inclined towards advocating a more
energetic attack than the nature of the opening apparently can bear. But we
believe that the great German master showed a true appreciation of the spirit
of this opening, which requires a treatment similar to that of the close game,
namely, a steadfast gradual development, content with the small advantage of
the first move.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6,"Morphy played here invariably 5...b5, followed by 6..
.Bc5; the move in the text was first brought into practice by Paulsen, and was
afterwards accepted as the standard defense, which in the majority of games
hitherto played has proven successful.",False
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3,"Anderssen prefers here 6.Bxc6+,
and then directs his attention to retaining both his knights, and preventing
the adversary from dissolving his doubled pawn. White persues here a different,
and in the present position novel, policy, and makes preparation for retaining
his light-square bishop, and resting his game upon confining the opponent's
dark-square bishop. Whether this plan is an amelioration of Anderssen's line
of attack can only be proved by repeated practical trials.",True
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Be7,"Against Anderssen's form of attack in this debut it is more usual to open an
outlet for the bishop by 6...g6. Black prefers to get his king into safety as
soon as possible, and therefore at once makes room to enable him to castle.",False
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Be7 7. h3,"Not so much for defensive purposes as with the view of subsequently
fortifying an attack by pawn to g4 against the opponent's kingside, after the
latter has castled.",True

favored by Morphy in similar situations, and was also adopted by Blackburne in
the tie match against Steintiz in the Vienna tournament. But both those
players had elected that course after having previously brought out thier
c1-bishop, while here White seemed to have time for this maneuver, even at the
cost of remporarily blocking out his dark-square bishop.",True

the bishop to d8; but Blackburne thinks that after the exchange, and since his
adversary was compelled to castle on the queenside, the chances of an attack
were at least equally balanced for both sides.",True

have been much stronger at this juncture, and there can be no doubt that this
move would have much improved his game. White's best answer then would have
been 20.e5 (for if 20.exd5 instead, Black would rejoin 20...Nf4, with an
excellent game). Most likely the game would have proceeded thus: 19...d5 20.e5
c4 21.h4 and now, whether Black advanced 21...f5 or 21...h5, White retained
still some considerable attack; in the former by 22.exf5, followed by 23.Ne5,
and in the latter case by the answer of 23.Ng5, followed soon by pawn to f4.
But, nevertheless, Black had a better chance then of repelling the onslaught,
and certainly if he once got out of the attack, even at the expense of
sacrificing a piece eventually, his fine array of well-supported pawns on the
queen's wing would have been most formidable.",True

sary for defensive purposes, but also threatening. Before moving the queen,
White could not utilize his dark-square bishop without subjecting his d-pawn
to capture. Now White menaces a break in with the queen, either at a5 or h6,
after removing the bishop, as actually occurred.",False

of queens at g7, would have augmented Black's prospects of prolonging the
fight; but, even if he succeeded in effecting the exchange, White's pawns and
pieces were better situated for the endgame.",True

the rook for the bishop would not have mended matters, on account of the
impending 27.Ng5, after capturing the rook. Nor would 25...Qd7 have been any
better, e.g.: 25...Qd7 26.exf5 Nxf5 (if 26...gxf5 instead, White would proceed
with 27.g6 at once) 27.Bxf5 gxf5 28.g6 Rxf6 29.gxh7+, and wins; for if 29...

for, if 27...hxg6, White replies 28.Ng5), though rather plain in comparision
with the fine variation which might have arisen in answer to 27.Nh4, which
would probably have led to a still more elegant conclusion, e.g.: 27.Nh4 Nxd5
28.Rxd5 Bxd5 29.Nxf5 Nxf5 (best) 30.Bxf5, threatening pawn to g6, and must win,
