"Anderssen first adopted this move in his match against Morphy, which at the time caused a great deal of animadversion amongst theorists, who were inclined towards advocating a more energetic attack than the nature of the opening apparently can bear. But we believe that the great German master showed a true appreciation of the spirit of this opening, which requires a treatment similar to that of the close game, namely, a steadfast gradual development, content with the small advantage of the first move.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it provides historical context, indicates the controversy among theorists, and justifies Anderssen's move based on the principles of the opening game in question.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d3"," Anderssen's opening move was initially met with strong criticism from theorists who favored more aggressive strategies. However, we now recognize that the opening they used was more about patient, long-term development akin to those found in closed positions."
"Morphy played here invariably 5...b5, followed by 6.. .Bc5; the move in the text was first brought into practice by Paulsen, and was afterwards accepted as the standard defense, which in the majority of games hitherto played has proven successful.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it describes a successful defense strategy rather than critiquing the current move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

"Anderssen prefers here 6.Bxc6+, and then directs his attention to retaining both his knights, and preventing the adversary from dissolving his doubled pawn. White persues here a different, and in the present position novel, policy, and makes preparation for retaining his light-square bishop, and resting his game upon confining the opponent's dark-square bishop. Whether this plan is an amelioration of Anderssen's line of attack can only be proved by repeated practical trials.",False,"

The comment explains a strategy rather than directly pointing out the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c3",-
"Against Anderssen's form of attack in this debut it is more usual to open an outlet for the bishop by 6...g6. Black prefers to get his king into safety as soon as possible, and therefore at once makes room to enable him to castle.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player in failing to prioritize king safety and castling, which are typical defensive strategies against Anderssen's attacking style.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Be7,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"," White's last move may not align with Blackburne's usual strategy. Typically, Blackburne would prioritize king safety and would consider a move like 6...g6 after 6. Bg5, allowing the king to castle quickly. This move may not be the best outlet for the bishop and might delay Blackburne's castling."
"Not so much for defensive purposes as with the view of subsequently fortifying an attack by pawn to g4 against the opponent's kingside, after the latter has castled.",True,".

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the defensive intent behind the move which was misplaced due to the lack of supporting development or control of the center, leading to a weaker position going forward.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Be7 7. h3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"," White's last move, playing Pawn to h3, might not seem strategic at first glance. They are not primarily aiming to defend but rather to create potential attacking opportunities by later advancing pawn to g4. This plan assumes that Black's king will be on the kingside due to castling. It's a long-term strategy that requires patience and precise execution."
"This peculiar way of bringing the knight over to the kingside was much favored by Morphy in similar situations, and was also adopted by Blackburne in the tie match against Steintiz in the Vienna tournament. But both those players had elected that course after having previously brought out thier c1-bishop, while here White seemed to have time for this maneuver, even at the cost of remporarily blocking out his dark-square bishop.",False,"

"For pure defensive purposes it would have been feasible to retreat the bishop to d8; but Blackburne thinks that after the exchange, and since his adversary was compelled to castle on the queenside, the chances of an attack were at least equally balanced for both sides.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights a potential strategic misstep by the player, suggesting a retreat to a safer position, but acknowledges the possibility of balanced chances for both sides.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Be7 7. h3 O-O 8. Qe2 Ne8 9. g4 b5 10. Bc2 Bb7 11. Nbd2 Qd7 12. Nf1 Nd8 13. Ne3 Ne6 14. Nf5 g6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W.

Although retreating the bishop to d8 could have been a safer option, Black believed that after the exchange, the likelihood of an attack would be roughly equal for both sides, considering the need to castle on the queenside."""
"Blackburne poined out that 19...d5 would have been much stronger at this juncture, and there can be no doubt that this move would have much improved his game. White's best answer then would have been 20.e5 (for if 20.exd5 instead, Black would rejoin 20...Nf4, with an excellent game). Most likely the game would have proceeded thus: 19...d5 20.e5 c4 21.h4 and now, whether Black advanced 21...f5 or 21...h5, White retained still some considerable attack; in the former by 22.exf5, followed by 23.Ne5, and in the latter case by the answer of 23.Ng5, followed soon by pawn to f4. But, nevertheless, Black had a better chance then of repelling the onslaught, and certainly if he once got out of the attack, even at the expense of sacrificing a piece eventually, his fine array of well-supported pawns on the queen's wing would have been most formidable.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by evaluating 19...d5 as a stronger move, suggesting a different course of action for White, and discussing the potential outcomes and challenges for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

From there, White had a means to counter with 22.exf5 or 23.Ng5. Regardless, Black had a better chance to defend, especially after breaking out of the attack and potentially sacrificing a piece. Their pawn structure on the queen's wing would have been particularly powerful.'"
"A move neces sary for defensive purposes, but also threatening. Before moving the queen, White could not utilize his dark-square bishop without subjecting his d-pawn to capture. Now White menaces a break in with the queen, either at a5 or h6, after removing the bishop, as actually occurred.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player as it explains the consequences of the move, including the defense and threat created, and how it led to potential loss of a dark-square bishop.",1. e4 e5 2.

Prior to this, White's dark-square bishop was blocked, which would have been risky if they had advanced their d-pawn.

"Perhaps 24...Nge8, with the intention of offering the exchange of queens at g7, would have augmented Black's prospects of prolonging the fight; but, even if he succeeded in effecting the exchange, White's pawns and pieces were better situated for the endgame.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as the move Nge8 did not improve Black's position and allowed White to maintain a stronger endgame.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

However, even if this exchange were successful, White's pawns and pieces were in a stronger position for the endgame."
"The sacrifice of the rook for the bishop would not have mended matters, on account of the impending 27.Ng5, after capturing the rook. Nor would 25...Qd7 have been any better, e.g.: 25...Qd7 26.exf5 Nxf5 (if 26...gxf5 instead, White would proceed with 27.g6 at once) 27.Bxf5 gxf5 28.g6 Rxf6 29.gxh7+, and wins; for if 29... Kf7 30.Ng5+ would be a destructive rejoinder.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake made by the player, as it highlights the potential consequences of the sacrifice and demonstrates how White could have gained a decisive advantage.",1. e4 e5 2.

If instead 29...Kf7, then White's 30.Ng5+ would be a significant advantage."
"Decisive ( for, if 27...hxg6, White replies 28.Ng5), though rather plain in comparision with the fine variation which might have arisen in answer to 27.Nh4, which would probably have led to a still more elegant conclusion, e.g.: 27.Nh4 Nxd5 28.Rxd5 Bxd5 29.Nxf5 Nxf5 (best) 30.Bxf5, threatening pawn to g6, and must win, for Black dare not take the rook on account of the answer 31.Be6.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, stating that the move hxg6 was a decisive mistake, but it was outplayed by a more superior line (if 27...hxg6, White plays 28.Ng5), which results in a better position for White.",1. e4 e5 2.

"There was little to be done; but certainly, if Black wished to proceed further, 29...Rf7 presented greater chances of prolonging resistance; but, as our readers may observe, both players were just at this stage on the point of completing the fixed time limit, and their movements bear the appearance of being hurried.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting that while the move was a blunder, the situation allowed for potential continuation and that the players were rushing to complete the time limit.",1. e4 e5 2.
