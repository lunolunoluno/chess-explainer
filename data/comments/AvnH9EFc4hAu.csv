"This is the King's Indian transposing into the Krause variation of the Grunfeld Reversed. c5 is an aggressive move attacking your center. Dxc5 is playable if you get all your development done in quick fashion, but it's generally not good to surrender the center. Much more aggressive and to the point is c4 transposing into the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit which is a much more aggressive attacking line for you undermining his center.

"3....e6 by your opponent was a mistake. He could've and should've kept up with development of his king knight to f6 giving his queen pawn strength with a developing move and also taking command of your K4 square. Rather than the text, you should've considered playing 4. Be3 with the idea of fianchettoing your king bishop and retaining the extra pawn. Notice this will prevent black's king bishop from taking control of that powerful diagonal that you tried to get him off later in the game. After Bxc5, you played correctly by e3, but life's not easy for you. You have what is known as a pawnless center, meaning no pawns on the fourth rank. Your opponent's fifth move was a blunder. He should've continued with the more logical Nf6 once again.",True," The comment provides specific reasoning for the mistake, highlighting a missed opportunity to improve development and pawn structure.",1.

Nxd7 is not a beneficial exchange for you because you're trading your knight for Black's bad bishop (bishop of the same color squares as his pawns are occupying). Na4 was an error because you can't chase the bishop off that diagonal and because it's never a sound idea to attack a piece that can move away unless it's for tactical reasons (decoy and deflection).,True, The comment identifies a specific tactical mistake – the bishop's lack of a viable path – and explains why it’s a poor exchange.,1.

"Black has no merit for giving up a piece with 11....Nxb4; he simply gives you a material advantage. Castling is prime in importance in the opening to get your king to safety. After 13.

Now you possess a half-open b-file with a rook controlling it and a powerful knight that cannot be chased away by pawns. Notice you put pressure on a pawn that can't move at the moment (his a6 pawn).
