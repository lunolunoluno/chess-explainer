"In 1892, at ""Cafe' de la Regence"" a tournament was organized among the strongest players who were present in Paris at that time. The prize was 500 francs. Janowsky and Sittenfeld were those who play against each other in the final match. The result, in favour of our hero, was +7 -5 =5. The game which is now presented here won the beauty prize of 30 francs.",False,"

The comment is discussing a historical chess tournament and its results, which does not provide any information about a specific move made by a player, therefore it does not explain any mistake.",1. Nf3,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3",-
Janowsky would not have disliked (in case of 3.c4) the Chigorin Defense even if such a defense was already at that time partially condemned by the theory.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses a potential alternative defense rather than addressing the specific error in the move.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5",-
A bit too shy. Wasn't it better to castle and then attack the center with c2-c4?,True,"

Explanation: The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move, suggesting that the player missed an opportunity to develop their pieces and control the center, which is a common fundamental principle in chess strategy.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c3", The move was premature. It would have been more strategic for White to castle and then control the center with c2-c4.
Unclear...,False,"

The comment ""Unclear..."" does not provide enough context or explanation for the mistake made by the player; it lacks specificity and does not mention the nature or consequence of the error.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f1",-
...and Black profits from it at once.,True,"

The comment indicates that the move played by Black resulted in an immediate advantage or benefit, likely as a consequence of the initial mistake made by the opponent.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4"," ""Black's move was immediately disadvantageous."""
"The first mistake. It was better to play immediatly 10. Ng1 to force the Bishop exchange and to open the kingside to the air, since it is beginning to ""smell sweat"".",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake by suggesting an alternative move that could have potentially improved the position or created a tactical situation.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3"," They made an error by moving their knight to g1. It would have been more strategic to initiate a bishop exchange and open up the kingside, as the opponent's position was becoming tense."
Very good!,False,"

The comment ""Very good!"" does not explain the mistake made by the player as it contradicts the assertion that the move was evaluated as a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5",-
"So, even a ble breaking attempt with c3-c4 is prevented. But that's not all. This move and the following ones, as we shall see, are part of a deep strategical plan to further reduce the space available for the opponent. A real attempt to strangle him!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the strategic intention behind the move and subsequent moves that aim to constrict the opponent's space.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5", Black's last move with Pawn to b5 doesn't just disrupt the opponent's space; it's part of a strategic plan aimed at restricting the opponent's mobility further.
Exclamation mark!,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a significant mistake, possibly losing a piece or significantly weakening their position.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h6"," ""A risky move by Black, putting their queen in a vulnerable position!"""
Forced. 16...Nxg3 was threatened.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake because 16...Nxg3 was indeed a forced move and threatened the opponent's king.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f1", The move 16...Nxg3 was not forced and was weak.
"No! Too passive! Also, let's say it: it is humiliating too! It seems that White is taken by terror. The threat f2-f3 is unreal and allows Black....",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake for being too passive and highlights the unrealistic threat of f2-f3, which allows Black certain advantages.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17. Ng1,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g1"," The White player's last move was not aggressive enough and it's disappointing. It appears that they are afraid, and this move doesn't pose any real threat to Black."
Wonderful!,False,"

The comment ""Wonderful!"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests admiration rather than a critique of the move.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17. Ng1 e5,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5",-
(?) Sittenfeld could not resist to such temptation.,True,"

The comment suggests that the player, Sittenfeld, made a mistake due to a strong attraction or temptation, possibly misleading or misinterpreting the situation on the chessboard.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17. Ng1 e5 18. f3,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3", Black may have made a poor decision with their last move.
Down! In the mouth of the enemy!,True,"
The comment ""Down! In the mouth of the enemy!"" clearly indicates that the player made a poor move that could potentially lead to their defeat, suggesting that the move was a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e4", 'Black's move to e4 is aggressive but risky.'
To defend against Bd6xg3+.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it simply states a potential threat without providing insight into the inadequate defensive move.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17. Ng1 e5 18. f3 Qh4+ 19. g3 Nxg3 20. Nxg3 e4 21. f4,"This is a game between Sittenfeld (as White) and Janowsky, David (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4",-
Breathless! (A Bout de souffle!),True,"
The comment ""Breathless! (A Bout de souffle!)"" indicates that the move is unexpected and surprising, implying that it was a mistake as it deviates from the standard play.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17.

(?),False,"

Now the King is out of is lair and Black goes to the queenside.,True,"

Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on b4"," Black's last move, a pawn capture on b4, has placed Black's king in a vulnerable position by exposing it to potential threats, especially since it's now out of its usual defensive setup. This move could lead to a compromised kingside if not addressed properly."
It's time!,True,"

The comment ""It's time!"" implies that the player should have advanced their position or made a more aggressive move, rather than the one they played, which suggests they missed a better opportunity.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17.

(!),True,"

The ""(!)"" notation indicates that the player made a blunder, or a significant mistake, which is why the comment explains the mistake made.",1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qb3 Rb8 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Nf1 Ne4 9. Ng3 O-O 10. Bd3 f5 11. a3 Kh8 12. Bd2 b5 13. Qc2 a5 14. b4 Qf6 15. Bc1 Qh6 16. Nf1 Qh5 17. Ng1 e5 18. f3 Qh4+ 19. g3 Nxg3 20. Nxg3 e4 21. f4 exd3 22. Qxd3 g5 23.
