This form of the exchange variation is now considered harmless.,False,"

Nf3,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Mason, J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"
7...c6 would have been wiser. Black is overly concerned with the g5-square.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies Black's mistake and explains that developing the c6-pawn would have been a better move than targeting the g5-square.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. O-O h6,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Mason, J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
"Bird: The opening is much as usual, this move and Mr. Mason's play to preserve his bishop from being changed off taking it a little out of the beaten track.",False,"

The comment does not explicitly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only describes the opening and attempts to justify the move without pointing out its flaws.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7"
White has advanced pawns and the structure is a bit weak. Therefore the initiative must be maintained. Notice that the advance of the h-pawn has weakened g6.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by explaining how the advancement of the h-pawn weakened the pawn structure, suggesting that White should maintain the initiative.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. O-O h6 8. Re1 Nc6 9. Nb5 Bb4 10. c3 Ba5 11. Na3 Bg4 12. Nc2 Qd7 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Bh5 15. Ne3 Rfe8 16. b5 Ne7 17. g4 Bg6 18.

"The queen would have been better placed at d8, so that after ...Ne4 the kingside could be infiltrated on the dark squares.",True,"

This comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, highlighting the misplaced queen and the strategic disadvantage it created on the kingside.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

White could have played 19.Nxg6 Nxg6 20.Bxg6 fxg6 21. Qd3 but Black has a strong reply in 21...Kh7 22.Bd2 Qd8 followed by ...Ne4.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out a tactical theme in the position, where Black can exploit a weakened position after White's premature knight trade.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

19...a6 20.a5 Ba7 was an interesting alternative.,True,"

The comment explains that the move 20...Ba7 was an alternative to the more common move 20...Bg4, indicating that it was not a mistake, but just a less popular choice among players.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Not a brilliancy, as generally considered, but a terrible mistake. Bird: This move initiates a combination of remarkable interest, besides affording scope for some of the best play of both of these well-known players.",False,"

"The best follow up, from a practical standpoint. But is it any good?",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player. It seems to be indicating that while the move might have a practical application, its overall quality or effectiveness is questionable.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Bd6 6.

"Bird: A note to this game in the Illustrated London News observed ""This is quite a la Bird. For once in a way our countryman wakes up and comes out in his old brilliant style.""",False,"

"There really isn't anything better, but the move doesn't really deserve the double exclamation mark it usually gets. Bird: ""If in reply Black takes the rook at e1 he loses his queen; if he captures the other rook he is mated. Capturing the knight was available, but looks extremely dangerous.""",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the significant loss (queen) or immediate checkmate (taking the rook) that would result from Black's potential responses, and points out that capturing the knight was a safer option.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Generally criticized, but maybe not so bad after all.",True,"

The comment indicates that the move was evaluated negatively and was considered a mistake, but the author also suggests that it may not be as bad as originally thought.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because moving the pawn forward without sufficient support leaves it vulnerable to attacks from the opponent.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Now White has some real threats and practical chances. Bird: ""Every move is an attack and demands excessive vigilance on the part of the second player.""",True,"
