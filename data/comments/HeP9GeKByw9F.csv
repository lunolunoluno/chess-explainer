It seemed to me the variation used to play by my opponent against system with g3 is rather doubious. That's why I chose this move. Nevertheless it was not so easy way indeed.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only mentions the choice of a variation against a certain system and does not address the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3,"This is a game between Sakaev, Konstantin (as White) and Mrva (as Black).

"Very effective multifunctional move proving an advantage. White keeps a couple of pieces, consolidates plentifully the f2 square, clears the 3rd rank for the Rook (subsequently not for Rb1-b3 but Rh1-h3-a3!), and also threating 19.ef5 gf5 20.g4 and then it will be able to put the knight into the play through the e3 square.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it praises the move as effective and multifunctional, which is inconsistent with considering it a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

Makes White worsen his pawn structure of queenside.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a strategic mistake that weakens the white player's pawn structure on the queenside, which could limit their mobility and potentially lead to tactical disadvantages.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

Strengthening the light-square bishop and preparing h1 Rook's manoevre.,False,"

White threatens nothing immediately but Black is completely pinned and can't find any useful move.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the immediate consequences of the move, pointing out that Black is in a disadvantageous position and lacks good options.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5.
