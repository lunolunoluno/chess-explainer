"Too passive. Much stronger is 17. c3 Bc5 18. Bc8, forcing black to sacrifice his rook because of white's threat of b8(Q), and after exchanges on c8, would leave white up a full rook!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting a passive move that could be more aggressive and strategic by forcing Black to sacrifice a rook and potentially gain a material advantage.",1.

"No. Now that most pieces are exchanged, the king is a fighting piece -- the threat of mate is non-existent. White should try to support his passed b-pawn with 20. Kc3.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by explaining that with most pieces exchanged, the king becomes a fighting piece, and the threat of checkmate is gone, suggesting the player should support the passed pawn with the knight move.",1.

"This works, but 21. Bc8! Kf8 22. Rd1 would leave black in a complete bind. Black would be helpless to stop white's plan of advancing her queen-side pawns, and forcing a breakthrough on b6.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the potential consequences of the move and highlighting the threat of advancing white's queen-side pawns, which would put black in a difficult position.",1.

"? Not the best. Let's take a look here. What are the key elements of this position? Elements of chess are king safety, material imbalances, space, development, for example. In this case, the key facts are: 1) White has an extra bishop, and 2) the passed, PROTECTED pawn on b7. The b7 pawn has the most potential, and should have been preserved if at all possible. In this case it was, by playing Bc6 instead. Then the plan of 23. Rd1, Rd7, Rxc7, followed by Rc8 is winning outright.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake, highlighting the missed opportunity to maintain the protective position of the b7 pawn, which was crucial for the overall strategy and winning potential of the game.",1.

"Not the best. The general rule of thumb when up a piece is in endgame is: Trade pieces, NOT pawns. Conversely, if someone is losing, they should trade pawns, not pieces. Correct was to preserve white's b-pawn with 24. b3. The text makes it more difficult for white to win.",True,"

The comment correctly highlights why the move was a mistake by pointing out the general strategy of trading pawns instead of pieces in the endgame, and how the proposed move would have been more effective.",1.

"Again, now that mate threats are minimal, aggressive use of the king is called for. White should advance toward the center with Kd2.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it is more of a strategic suggestion rather than an analysis of the error itself.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2.

?! Dubious. White's bishop was already well placed on d5. More logical was to get white's king involved in the action with Ke2.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the move as a mistake by emphasizing the better alternative of involving the white king in the game, as the bishop on d5 was already in a powerful position.",1.

Unnecessarily passive. Ke2 is still best.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move Ke2 was unnecessary and suggests a better alternative, indicating that the player made a mistake in their move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2.

"So in conclusion, watch out for your opponent's threats, and if you have passed pawns on the 7th rank (row), do all you can to protect them. They can often decide games if they can queen, because they will force more valuable pieces to sac themselves to stop it. Also, in endgames, use your king to support your passed pawns, and to limit the activity of your opponent's king.",False,"
