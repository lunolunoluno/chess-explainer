"Gelfand plays openings which are ideal for an aggressive player, but he isn't a wild-eyed tactician; he's a planner and classical positional player.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the specific mistake made since it discusses Gelfand's general style rather than the particular move.",1. e4 c5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
"White's aim is to open the e-file or to ""break"" Black's pawn structure. The immediate threat of e5-e6 is reminiscent of an Alekhine's Defense position. If White doesn't play e4-e5 immediately then Black might get sufficient control of e5 to keep White boxed-in on the light squares.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses more on the potential consequences of the move rather than the specific error.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"
Black tries to keep control of e5 to prevent White from playing g2-g4 followed by Nf3-e5.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as they aimed to maintain control of the e5 square to prevent White from potentially gaining an advantage with the pawn structure and piece placement after g2-g4 and Nf3-e5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6"
While Black gets good piece activity the poor pawn structure must make Gelfand a little nervous.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights the potential weakness in the pawn structure that may have led to a tactical disadvantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on d6"
"Playing a Nh4 or Nd4 to add pressure to the pin on Nf3 would be desirable, but White can step out of the pin with Qd1-e1. Black has to do more, so he castles and prepares to bring more forces into play.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, emphasizing the lack of pressure on White's pinned knight and suggesting a better alternative strategy for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle"
"Though White needs to clear the way for Bc1 to develop it's a little odd to see him weaken Nf3 this way. Does he intend to move Bc1 and then play Ne4-d2 to re-establish the defense of Nf3, or is g2-g4 still being considered?",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it questions White's decision to weaken the Nf3 knight without a clear strategy, suggesting alternative moves and considering the possibility of g2-g4 as a future plan.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e4"
"White's pawn structure is quite modest, but from that his pieces might spring forward. Only the pin on Nf3 is troublesome.",True,"

The comment explains the move because it highlights the benefits of White's pawn structure and the pin on Nf3 as potential disadvantages, implying that the move may not have been the best choice considering these factors.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1"
"It appears Black might want to play ...e6-e5 to secure control of d4 and f4, but he might also have in mind to play ...Bd6-f8 to keep the bishop on the board.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it only provides possible future moves without addressing the specific error.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to e8"
"So, this is the idea behind Nd2-e4. Black has to either retreat and give up on the pin on Nf3 or give up one of the bishops for a knight. He could trade off Bd6 (13...Bxg3 14. fxg3) or Bh5 (13...Bxf3 14. Qxf3) .",True,"

The comment accurately explains the potential loss of material for Black by either retreating the bishop and giving up the pin on the knight, or trading off the bishop for a knight, both of which would significantly weaken Black's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g3"
"Apparently he didn't see any immediate value to trading, so he keeps the two bishops in hopes of some future time when they'll be especially valuable.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as the player failed to recognize the immediate advantage of bishop exchange, hoping for a future situation where his bishops would be more valuable.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g6"
I don't understand giving up Pc5 in this situation. What plan does Black follow which demands the bishop be at c7 rather than d6 or f8?,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it questions the strategy behind the move, suggesting that the position allows for stronger placement of the bishop.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c7"
"Black threatens to open the position, possibly with ...f7-f5, ...e5-e4, before White can complete his development.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential opening moves Black could play, which would put pressure on White's position and allow Black to gain an advantage by completing their development before White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
"White, apparently, is not terribly impressed and simply uses Pa3 to oppose Nd5 and possibly to support b2-b4, whereby Nc5 is defended and Bc1-b2 becomes available.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the move's purpose and potential consequences, indicating that White's move could be a strategic attempt to counter Black's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
"The resulting weakness at d4 seems trivial. The more important thing is to get rid of Nd5, so Bc1 can be developed to a useful square.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the created weakness at d4 and suggests a strategic repositioning of the bishop to improve the situation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"
"just keeping Pd4 defended, however awkward it may be",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake because it simply describes the move without explaining the reason for it being a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4 Nf6 18. d4 e4 19. Ne5 Bh5 20. Qd2,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Gelfand, Boris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
"This clearly indicates he intends to get rid of Ne5 with his rook, hoping to retain control of f4 with Qd6 & Bc7.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake as it highlights the intention of the opponent to sacrifice the knight on f5 by relocating the rook to avenge Ne5, and the subsequent plan involving Qd6 and Bc7 to maintain control over the central f4 square.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4 Nf6 18. d4 e4 19.

Black has reached an impasse. His queen and rooks and even Bc7 are blocked severely on dark squares by Pd4 & Ne5.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by pointing out the blockade of Black's pieces on dark squares, limiting their mobility and strategic options.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4 Nf6 18. d4 e4 19. Ne5 Bh5 20. Qd2 Qd6 21.

White keeps Pd4 and Be3 to maintain control of the central dark squares.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it describes the loss of control over the central dark squares due to the retreat of the pawn and the bishop.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4 Nf6 18. d4 e4 19. Ne5 Bh5 20.

White wins one exchange and now threatens two more! This looks like a catastrophe for Black.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the immediate consequences of the move, indicating a significant advantage for White in terms of material and threats.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 e6 8. exd6 Bxd6 9. d3 Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Ne4 Nd5 12. Re1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne4 Bc7 15. Nxc5 e5 16. a3 f5 17. c4 Nf6 18. d4 e4 19.

At this moment it appears Black has made the necessary breakthrough. Be5 is a powerhouse and Rd3 is also very good.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it praises the moves made by the black player instead of addressing the error from the white player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4.

"White seems satisfied to repeat the position. Black may think he has the better of it, so he tries for more. I don't think that's a wise decision.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, suggesting that the player is attempting to gain an advantage by repeating the position, but it is not a wise decision.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4.

This move is what Black allowed when he refused to repeat the position and played 29...Re7. White now threatens Nc5xe4.,True,"
