1. e4,"As I was finishing this book I took part in one of the regular all-Master
training tournaments held monthly in the San Francisco area. I found myself
paired with a very strong opponent, Mike Arne (2400 FIDE). Since we were due to
meet a few weeks later in an IM norm tournament, I decided that I shouldn't
play my special preparation for him.  Naturally with so much Spielmann on my
mind I turned to one of his favorite lines, the Worral Attack in the Spanish
Game. My preparation consisted solely of annotating a few games for this book,
and the choice was made at the board.  So this game shows that it is not
necessary to study a lot of opening theory as White in the Spanish Game. All
that is needed is some basic concepts, and either courage or recklessness!",True
