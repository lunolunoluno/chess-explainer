This makes me wonder what Shirov had in mind that might make Kasparov change direction. This move is so out of character for Kasparov that I have doubts he has any kind of theoretical novelty; instead I think he just wants to prevent Shirov from having his way.,True," The comment suggests a possible strategic intention, indicating a potential shift in thinking.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This is a typical, and necessary, response to White's effort to get the central pawn duo (Pe4 & Pd4) .

"There are a couple of elements of this position which resemble a Slav, Exchange Variation. The main difference, of course, is the pawn at e5 rather than (say) e3. White's Bc1 can still develop freely and Bg7 is blocked, but Pd4 is also permanently weak.",True," The comment identifies a potential positional weakness, suggesting a mistake, but lacks specific analysis of the move's impact.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Yes, this is ugly, but it's the only way to force Nh4 back, block Pf2 and free Bg7. It doesn't appear to hurt the safety of Kg8 since there are several pieces around him to defend. There is, however, still a possibility of Ne4 becoming stuck, as in the Kasparov-Adams game (Petrov's Def.) where Black's Qe4 got stuck.",True," The comment highlights a potential tactical weakness and suggests a risky move, indicating a flawed assessment of the resulting position.",1. e4 c5 2.

"If the best Kasparov can do is regain one of the bishops then he has to admit Black's success, or rather his own inability to put a dent in Shirov's fine play.
