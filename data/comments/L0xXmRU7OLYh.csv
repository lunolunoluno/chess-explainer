"A blast from the past - You need to go as far back as the Yerevan Olympiad 1996 for Garry's last Scheveningen, when he faced Topalov. Kasparov has never really been one to play the Najdorf with ..e5, and usually always falls back on ..e6.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player using a reference from a past game that demonstrates Garry's typical move preferences against Topalov, implying that the player's move deviates from those tendencies.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Kasparov, G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6"," Shirov, playing as White, opted for the less common e6 move, deviating from the usual e5 preference in the Najdorf variation. This choice was a departure from Kasparov's (Black) typical strategies, where e6 has been a recurring theme, even against opponents like Topalov in the Yerevan Olympiad 1996."

"If Rb1 or Qc1, ..Bc5 is awkward. As for 0-0? It looks as if Black can simply take on b2 safely as there's no real attack or threat from White.",True,"

The annotation comment correctly identifies a potential weakness in the player's position by suggesting alternative moves that could lead to a defensive error, and it justifies the evaluation of the original move as a mistake by highlighting the lack of threat or attack from White.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Knight to f5"," If White plays Rb1 or Qc1, Black's...Bc5 could be awkward. As for castling with 0-0, it appears that Black can safely take on b2 since there's no real attack or potential threat from White."
"Black's easily equalised - And, as they say in the Sicilian: If Black has equalised, he's winning!",True,"

"The only move. If Black gets to keep the queen's on, he stands much better. Now, due to the opposite coloured bishops and the formation of both sets of pawns, White can realistically look for the draw.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by addressing the potential threat to the queen, the strategic positioning of the opposite colored bishops, and the pawn structure that could lead to a draw.",1. e4 c5 2.

(as White) and Kasparov, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d1", White's queen to d1 is a risky move. Black stands to gain if White's queen is captured.

There's just no way through for Kasparov now.,True,"
