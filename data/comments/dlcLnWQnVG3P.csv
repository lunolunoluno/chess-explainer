"Kramnik mentioned that all the moves up to here were played by the program very quickly, meaning most of this is probably theory in the Fritz opening book. Here we should take stock. Fritz just played a good move (10. h4) securing his f4 knight by preventing the natural g5 advance by black. However, the f4 knight seems like white's only trump. The pawns on c3 an c4 are weak, black has the two knights in a closed position, and white's king is in the center while black's is in safety. However, the c4 pawn has the useful function of keeping the knight out of d5 while the c3 fellow solidifies d4. White has a solid position, but unless the bishops can be unleashed, black will have a slight advantage.",True," The comment accurately identifies a potential weakness in white's position due to the pawn structure and the lack of developed pieces, suggesting a strategic misstep.",1. c4 e5 2.

"Kramnik should leave e7 for the knight. I suggest 10...Qe8 or 10...Ne7.

"Wow. The first time I've ever seen Fritz decline a pawn. If Fritz doesn't see a mate in the line or decisive material advantage then he usually grabs material without second thought. However, here he didn't see decisive material advantage or mate and he DID declind the c7 pawn. Perhaps Fritz is starting to understand the position more with the new version?

It's a completely understandable mistake. Fritz is striving for bishop activity. 18. c6? can't be played because the a3 bishop would be hanging. Therefore Fritz logically defends it which allows him to play c6. Fritz is forgetting about his more important minor piece! The f4 knight. It was imperitive to play 18. h5 to prevent any exchange of the f4 knight by Nh5 for instance.

"From this point on, Black has good counterplay on the kingside. What's the strategy called? Development! After the f4 knight leaves the kingside black has a lead in development over on the kingside.

"This has the greedy motive behind it against the a7 pawn. The a7 pawn is worthless though, more important is undermining the key pawn at d5! I believe 22. c4!? would be much to Fritz's advantage.
