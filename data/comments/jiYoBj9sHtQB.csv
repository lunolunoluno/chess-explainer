"He varies from 1. c4, perhaps because he thinks his opponents are now focusing on him and finding particular plans to defeat him, rather than taking him for granted. He might just be tired (for the moment) of his usual opening.",True," The comment suggests a possible tactical or psychological reason for the move, indicating a potential shift in strategy.",1.

It takes the game out of the realm of the English Opening (generally) . There are others who don't depend so fully on ...e5, so they might consider a King's Indian Defense set-up (generally aiming for ...e7-e5 after some development moves) or a symmetrical ...c7-c5.",True," The comment identifies a potential strategic misstep by the player, suggesting a deviation from established opening principles.",1.

"This move continues to hide Black's intentions, to a certain extent. Often it's played like a Nimzo-Indian Defense, so that 3. Nc3 Bb4 helps Black fight for control of d5 and e4. To achieve the same end he might continue with the direct and classical ...d7-d5 or with a more modern Queen's Indian Defense (...b7-b6, ...Bc8-b7) . There are also other approaches: something completely different like ...c7-c5, delaying the development of Bc8 until he has ...Nb8-c6. To add to the confusion there is also a possibility of a Benoni Defense (3. d4 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6) when Black fianchettoes the dark-square bishop after all. It's potentially quite confusing.",True," The comment offers several possible alternative lines of play that could explain why the move was considered a mistake, indicating a potential strategic miscalculation.",1.

"Black has had good success with this, with GM Nick DeFirmian as one of it's best proponents. It aims to play an open position after d2-d4 cxd4 very actively before White can develop and remove his king from the center.

"Black chooses a kind of Queen's Indian Defense formation with an early ...c7-c5. By attempting to nullify White's Bg2 early-on Black should do alright. He's also kept Pd7 to keep Ke8 safe and to guard c6. Keeping those pawns (Pd7, Pe6, Pf7) on light squares can be very useful if Bc8 is traded off. If there is no early trade we might see those pawns move to other squares (...d7-d5 for example) .",True," The comment offers potential strategic insights into why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting a specific pawn structure and strategic goals.",1.

GM Walter Browne utilized this plan against GM Alexander Ivanov several years ago in the United States championship. It was copied by many people soon after and usually with good results. Black hadn't planned (perhaps) on having to deal with another White pawn advancing in the center so quickly.

"This is a nice response. Just get rid of the knight. White can't utilize the diagonal because ...Ne4xc3 hits White's queen.

"Vallejo Pons used the Pc4 & Pe4 formation in his game against Kasparov, so this isn't unfamiliar to him. Those pawns block both Bg2 and Bb7, so let's look at other factors to decide who is better or has a better continuation. With e4-e5 it's hard to see Black getting a grip on the dark squares with ...Nb8-c6, ...d7-d5, ...Be7-f6, but Black could challenge Pe4 more directly with ...d7-d5 or ...O-O and ...f7-f5. White will have to concede to pawn exchanges (else his central pawn structure would become broken) or to moving Nf3, so he can advance f2-f4.

"This is an interesting change of tack. White opens things up, but he doesn't have the best grip on d5 since Nc3 is gone.

"It appears Adams decided he might need that bishop for later duty, perhaps defending Pd6, and so he gives it a retreat square.

"I wonder if after Ne3 Adams regretted not capturing it on move 20. Now the knight controls d5, to keep the central bind, and it might hop over to g4 to threaten invasion at f6 or h6.
