"The White pawn on f3 supports the White e4-pawn, rules out Nf6-g4, and often allows White to play g2-g4 if needed to support his kingside ambitions. This setup chosen by Garry is very solid and practical. White prepares to meet the Black king with Be3-h6, followed by h2-h4-h5 with an automatic attack should Black castle kingside. Should Black lag in development then White can switch gears and strike in the center with e4-e5.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic maneuver to challenge the Black king.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
