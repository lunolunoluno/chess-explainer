"It is not a secret that Kasparov�s favorite move here is 1...c5, leading to the Sicilian Defense. But, since this defense can lead to rather sharp positions, which Black wants to avoid, he chooses to play 1...e5 instead. This is a very solid move, which usually leads to complex positions, and thus seems a perfect choice for this match.",True,"

"This time Kasparov goes for the straight forward way of defending the 'e5' pawn, even though he actually won the game with the Petroff last year.

"This doesn't seem to be a great place for the white knight, but it really doesn't matter, because the knight is en route to much bigger things.

"Kasparov finally gets off the well trodden path of chess theory with this interesting move.

"A beautiful and very subtle move by Deep Blue, showing an amazing understanding of the position on the computer's behalf. The queen comes to e2 for two diametrically opposed purposes: first of all, it is a defensive move. Now that the control of the 'f4' square is not so important, the queen moves over to the d1-h5 diagonal, thus preempting any tactical strikes that could have followed after the black knight's jump to g5. At the same time, the queen on e2 is putting additional pressure on the b5 pawn, and threatening to continue adding to it with Bc2-d3.",True," The comment offers a plausible explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic goal beyond simple tactical gain.",1. e4 e5 2.
