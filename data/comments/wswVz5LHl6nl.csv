"Ivanchuk is an enigma. He's capable of some horrificly complicated tactical melees and of some brilliancies, but he's also capable of exceedingly odd play. He usually begins with 1. e4, but will play whatever suits his needs. Here he plays 1. Nf3, it's first occurrence of the tournament, and what kind of game does he desire? Who knows, perhaps not even him.",True," The comment offers insight into the player's tactical and strategic approach, suggesting a potentially unbalanced game.",1.

"Kasparov offers a transposition to a Sicilian Defense by 2. e4.

"This isn't so terrific. It's an indication Ivanchuk doesn't want to play a King's Indian Attack (5. d3) , but wants to fight Kasparov's pieces head-on. However, in this opening you can't always force such things without dire consequences.

"In many of Kasparov's games an exposed Pc4, or in this case Pc5, has given him problems. His choice to exchange-off that pawn probably didn't take him long. It gives the c3 square back to White, so Nb1-c3 will be available. But, Black's Ng8 isn't required to develop to f6 to block Bg7 (as Nf3 does to Bg2) . It can develop Ng8-h6-f5 or with ...e7-e6, Ng8-e7 and Black's position will be very harmonious.",True," The comment identifies a potential tactical flaw and suggests a strategic opportunity for White, indicating a misjudgment.",1.

"Both sides have developed sensibly, but now what? Bg2 isn't especially terrific, so White might think of e2-e4, but Black has aligned against Pd4 to prevent that.

"He seems terribly concerned White will get to play e3-e4 in an advantageous way; so it appears he will also play ...Ng8-f6 to control square e4.

"This move is a bit hard to decipher. He might be intending ...f7-f5 to expand on the king-side, while threatening to open the f-file for a Black rook.

"Ivanchuk beats Kasparov to the punch and makes his own king-side gesture. Of course there's no way to know, just yet, whether this could succeed or backfire. If the c-file opens and rooks are traded it might not mean anything.

"With 17...Ng8 Kasparov seemed to be just maneuvering, but here he seems to be saying knights are much better than bishops in this kind of position (with this many pawns and few or no good open diagonals for a bishop) .
