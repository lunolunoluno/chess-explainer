"In view of the weak pawn skeleton c6-d5-e6-f5, it would seem important for Black to preserve his light squared Bishop for the defence, and according to Flohr, it's absence from d7 will weigh decisively in White's favour as soon as he succeeds in opening some lines",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic consideration.",1. d4 e6 2.
