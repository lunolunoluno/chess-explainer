"Deep Fritz thinks that Timmerman's move 24...Rd5 is not good. 24...c6 looks a bit like a draw (= 0.37). After a few minutes Fritz switches to 24...Rhe8 with a +0.56 score. Maybe Kasparov is winning?! Well, Shirov is in a big think. He's probably looking for a way to escape. Our bets are now on Kasparov.",True,"
