"Lasker increases his control over e4.

The e5-pawn looked adequately defended (by two pieces) but this was just an illusion. Both of the defending pieces are more valuable than the attacking ones.

"Despite the fact that he has more pawns on the board, Reti's at a disadvantage. His d-pawns are hideously weak and one of them will probably fall soon. Although in theory the piece trades should have favored White's pawn majority, Lasker's creative play in causing weaknesses has turned things around.

Now we see what Black's maneuvering was all about. He's now controlling two of the three squares the b4-pawn must traverse on its way to promotion. The promotion square can't be guarded by a White piece (the Bishop is shut out from ever defending b1).
