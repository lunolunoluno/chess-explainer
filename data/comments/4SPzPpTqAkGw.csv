"This game was the most difficult but also the most noteworthy one for me in the first part of the SEMI English thematic tournament. After having lost without a fight to the same oponent my black game I felt like winning here for a long time - before I truly recognized the strength of the endgame technique of Jorje Miraglia. The game is a very good example of what can be called ""the turning points"" in a chess game. There are three turning points here which I try to point out and comment thoroughly. The ability to recognize such points and change one's plans accordingly is, no doubt, one of the finest chess skills.

"Now, the first turning point of the game has been achieved.
