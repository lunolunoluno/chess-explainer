"Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side. And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece on d6.

"Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's still better.

"Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3 Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on if he wants to seal his move now. Some say that Kasparov might have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08. Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe) tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.
