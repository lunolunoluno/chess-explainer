"Hasting. August,5 - September,2 1895. A prestigious tournament, organized in order to compare the playing strength of the top chess champions at that time. Chigorin, Lasker, Tarrasch, Steinitz, Schlechter and other 17 players were participating. All of them were very strong players. Among them Janowsky and a new talented american player Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who won the tournament with 16.5 points out of 21. Janowsky, for various reasons not at his best playing strength, was however successfull in defending his reputation he had gained in Paris.",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it provides historical context about a chess tournament but does not specify the actual move or the reason for it being a mistake.",1. e4,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4",-
"Steinitz, always faithful to his favoured defense, this time has improved it with the move a7-a6.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only states that the move improves Steinitz's favored defense without addressing the specific mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e7",-
An interesting Bishop move.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it only describes the piece moved but does not provide any insight into why the move was a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b3",-
"What is that? Some strange impulse or a new idea? Janowsky seems ready to give his lightsquare Bishop for the sake of attack. Is that too much? Pillsbury, categorically, commented: ""Such a move should cost the game to White.""",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as it highlights a potentially risky move that could cost valuable material in the game.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," 'Black's move to exchange the light-squared bishop for an aggressive pawn play is questionable. An expert like 'White' may find this too risky, possibly leading to a disadvantageous position.'"
"(?) Pillsbury again: ""Probably this exchange is a real mistake. A deadly mistake, I would say. After 9...Bxf5 10. exf5 White would have lost a piece without compensation."" Is it possible that both Janowsky and Steinitz overlooked the simple continuation suggested by Pillsbury? Uhmm ... hard to believe. And in fact, the moves 9... Bxf5 10. exf5 c4 11. Nc3 (!) cxb3 12. axb3 followed by Rf1-e1 and Nc3-d5 (or Nc3-e4) should make worry the Black's conductor. Let's say that his position, with the King in the middle of the chessboard, half-undressed, seems at least unclear. Open windows and doors create air currents which are dangerous for healt. If, for instance, 12...Nxf5 then 13.Qd5 would win the piece back with advantage. If then White would play at once 11.Re1, Black, before taking the Bishop, should scratch his head and think about it one, two, ten times before doing it. Maybe Pillsbury, with the presumption tha can be told from his words, did ""pee counter wind"", to use an italian expression.",True,"

The comment provides a logical continuation of the moves suggested by Pillsbury, indicating a potential mistake made by the player and offering alternative moves that could lead to a better position for Black.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on f5"," The move suggested by Pillsbury, 9...Bxf5 followed by c4, cxb3, Nc3, cxb3, and potentially Rf1-e1 or Nc3-d5, is a poor strategy that Black seems to have overlooked. White retains a clear position with the King in the center, while Black's pieces are scattered, leading to potential vulnerabilities. The proposed move sequence may lead Black to reconsider before proceeding, and if White plays 11.Re1, Black might lose the Bishop for free. Pillsbury's advice implies caution against hasty decisions, akin to ""pee counter wind"" in Italian."
Of course now it is too late to play 10...c4 because of 11.Qe2+.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as moving the queen to e2+ would put the black king in check, which would be a bad move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on b3"," ""White's queen move (11.Qe2+) is inadvisable as it restricts Black's knight movement."""
"Maybe Steinitz has been too quick in willing to eliminate the dangerous lightsquare Bishop. Maybe, probably, surely indeed, Janowsky will show us that his opponent ""fell out the frying pan into the fire""!",False,"

The comment doesn't directly explain the mistake, as it's more of an opinion on the opponent's strategy rather than a specific critique of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1 with check",-
(!) Have you seen?,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it seems to be a fragment of a larger thought or question and lacks context.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+ Be7 12. f6,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f6",-
"Perhaps, as a last attempt to stop the imminent catastrophe, Steinitz could have tried 13...Be6 14.Qh5 Qd7.",True,"
The comment correctly identifies the mistake by suggesting a defensive move (13...Be6) that could have helped Steinitz avoid the described ""imminent catastrophe.""",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+ Be7 12. f6 gxf6 13. axb3 d5,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"," Black played Pawn to d5, a move that could be ineffective for their strategy. White's last move was 13...Be6, which steered the game into a challenging position for Black. Although they might try to counter with 14.Qh5 Qd7, this doesn't seem to solve the pressing issues Black is facing."
It is a bit difficult to think that Black could have escaped by sacrificing a Rook for a minor piece: 14...0-0 15.Bh6. And what if Steinitz wanted to save this too playing 15...Re8? Then after 16.Nc3 he could have left the table and go sell nuts and beans at the Astor movie theather in his hometown.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as sacrificing a Rook for a minor piece may not necessarily be the best escape plan for Black and the statement about Steinitz's hypothetical actions is irrelevant to the actual game.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+ Be7 12. f6 gxf6 13. axb3 d5 14.

"(!!) How does it begin the Fifth Simphony of Beethoven? Da-da-da.. .dawn! The ""theme of destiny""!",False,"

The comment references Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and its ""theme of destiny,"" which is unrelated to the assessment of the chess move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+ Be7 12. f6 gxf6 13. axb3 d5 14. Qh5 Qd6 15. Nc3 Be6 16. Nb5,"This is a game between Janowsky, David (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5",-
"Is it clear that White is aiming the ""e7"" and ""f6"" squares? No? Ok, let's go on.",True,"
The comment suggests that White's move is targeting the ""e7"" and ""f6"" squares, indicating the player made a mistake by not considering these potential threats.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf5 Nxf5 10. exf5 Nxb3 11. Re1+ Be7 12. f6 gxf6 13. axb3 d5 14. Qh5 Qd6 15. Nc3 Be6 16. Nb5 Qc6 17. Rxe6 Qxb5 18. Bh6 Kd8 19. Qxf7 Re8 20.

Now it should be clear!,True,"

The comment indicates that the mistake is evident and should be understood by any reasonable opponent.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9.

Last move played: White plays Bishop to g7", The move by White to g7 is problematic and exposes their King to potential threats.
The shortest way. Now one could announce mate in seven (Fritz says).,False,"

The comment doesn't directly explain the mistake, but rather hints at a possible outcome or threat after the mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Bb3 Na5 7. d4 exd4 8.

Steinitz resigns.,True,"

The comment ""Steinitz resigns"" indicates that the player made a critical mistake, resulting in a position that they deemed hopeless and decided to forfeit rather than continue.",1. e4 e5 2.
