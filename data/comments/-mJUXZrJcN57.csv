E32: Nimzo-Indian: Classical (4 Qc2): 4...0-0,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it identifies the opening used, Nimzo-Indian Defense, and points out the specific move played, 4 Qc2, which deviates from the Classical variation and leads to a potential loss of tempo.",1. d4,"This is a game between Kramnik, Vladimir (as White) and Tiviakov, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," E32: Nimzo-Indian: Classical (4 Qc2): The move played by White was inadequate because it does not contribute to the strategic goals of the opening, particularly in terms of controlling the central squares and preparing for the development of the bishops."

This move weakens Black's kingside defenses and creates holes that White might exploit later in the game."
