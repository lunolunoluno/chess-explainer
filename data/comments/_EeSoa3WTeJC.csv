Makes easier the defense for Black. Better was 5.Nf3.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by suggesting a better move for White, implying that the player's move weakened their position, making it easier for Black to defend.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5,"This is a game between Alekhine, Alexander (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5"

The comment ""(!)"" does not explicitly explain the mistake made by the player.

The comment ""Forced"" does not explain the mistake made by the player because it implies that the move was necessary, but it does not specify why it was inadequate or provide insight into a better alternative.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

The comment ""There was no choice"" does not provide a clear explanation for the mistake made by the player, as it does not address the specific move or the consequences of that decision.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

(!),True,"

The comment ""(!)"" indicates that the player made a blunder, which is a significant mistake often resulting in a substantial disadvantage or even loss of material.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a5"
"Mikenas: ""Alekhine looked nervous. It was necessary to realize the wrong opening strategy and try to keep equality with 14.Nc3.""",True,"

The comment explains the mistake well, as it indicates that the player made an error in choosing their opening strategy and that they are now attempting to maintain equality with the move 14.Nc3.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"(!) Now Black, gaining a tempo, can double his forces on the ""d"" file and create ""hidden"" threats.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as doubling their forces on the ""d"" file and creating potential threats can be considered a tactical advantage gained by the opponent.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O c5 8. e4 Nf6 9. e5 Nd5 10. dxc5 Na6 11. a3 Nxc5 12. b4 Ne6 13.

"Mikenas again:"" A GM with a world reputation should not fall in a trap. I think it is not necessary to point out that white is already in bad shape. It is the effect of the bad omen?""",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that Mikenas, presumably a chess player, fell into a trap and made a poor move, which suggests that their position is significantly weakened.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O c5 8. e4 Nf6 9. e5 Nd5 10. dxc5 Na6 11. a3 Nxc5 12. b4 Ne6 13. Bb2 a5 14. b5 Qd7 15. Qe2 Rd8 16.

Mikenas, in his article, confessed that he had not calculated in depth the consequences of his Knight sacrifice.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights a sudden decision that was unexpected and resulted in a significant loss (the Knight sacrifice), which was acknowledged by the author (Mikenas) as not being thoroughly analyzed.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it merely suggests a potential future threat rather than addressing the error made in the previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

(!) Threatens 20...Ne3.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only indicates that the move does not pose a threat to the opponent's knight on e3, rather than pointing out the reason behind the incorrect move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

(!) Threatens 22...Nf4 23.gxf4 Rxd2,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it only describes the consequences of the move without addressing why it was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"Only nervousnes s can explain such a mistake by Alekhine. It was necessary to defend with 23. Rac1. Witnesses tell that right in that moment a waiter brought some coffee to Alekhine. He thanked the waiter and still looking at the chessboard put a piece of sugar in the coffee cup. Only at the last moment he realized that it was not a piece of sugar but ... a white pawn. While he realized his mistake, he got upset, said something, pushed the cup away and .... coffee spilled out of the cup. Mikenas too noticed his opponent apparent nervousness, and perhaps distracted by this fact he immediately took the Knight.",True,"

The comment suggests that Alekhine's mistake was influenced by his nervousness and distraction, which aligns with the fact that he was engrossed in a conversation and accidentally put a white pawn in his coffee instead of a sugar cube, leading to the mistake in the chess move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"After this move Mikenas realized that strangely his opponent was smiling. With a trembling hand Alekhine pointed to the c2 square and said:"" Young man, if you played Rc2 you had won at once."" Mikenas confesses: ""Only after Alekhine's words I realized that I had such an opportunity.""",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by Mikenas as he failed to see the winning move (Rc2) for himself and it was only pointed out by Alekhine after Mikenas made the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"Annotations by Mikenas, in this game, are many and generous: ""In my analysis before the 23rd move, I had reached this position in my mind and indeed it looked promising. This explains, maybe, why I overlooked 23...Rc2 with the possibility of a beautiful win and the opportunity to take ... a beauty prize.""",True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it mentions the player overlooking the move 23...Rc2, which could have led to a winning opportunity.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.
