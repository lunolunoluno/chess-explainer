"Positions with one King castled Queenside and the other castled Kingside, set the players special problems. both sides feel constrained to attack vigorously, since passive play by either side will allow the opponent's attack to gather momentum It is quite obvioius that in playing for an attack, the first requirement is to get a file open for the Rooks; but this creates it's own problems. Any attempt to follow the advance given earlier in this chapter - not to embark on a flank attack until the centre is closed - would in the present case run into trouble, for if White play Pd5, Black can open the c-file without more ado. White therefore maintains the tension in the centre",True," The comment identifies a specific tactical and strategic problem stemming from the initial position, suggesting the move was poorly conceived.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"Now we can draw up a provisional balance sheet. White has won a pawn - not as yet a very important pawn - and has succeeded in half opening the g-file. Black's g-pawn and the Knight at h5, however, block any further progress in this sector. White has support point at d5, which may prove very important. Black for his part rejoices in the fully open c-file",True," The comment describes a strategic maneuver and potential future implications, suggesting a mistake rather than a straightforward loss.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"With these last few moves Black has made distinct progress. The b-file is an even better file for attacking the White King, and his dark squared Bishop is now a powerful reinforcement.
