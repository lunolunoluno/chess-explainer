"According to ""official theory"" (omnibus databases like ChessBase or ChessAssistant) this move leads to a difficult position for Black. So if Black decided to use it, he had to have had some vital improvment in mind. There are some alternatives here, for example:",True,"

"This is a very nice tactical blow, but it's also well-known...",False,"

This is a novelty. Maybe Areshchenko didn't know or forgot the following game:,True,"

"Now the king is unable to help his light pieces in their struggle against White's passed pawn, so Black resigned.",True,"
