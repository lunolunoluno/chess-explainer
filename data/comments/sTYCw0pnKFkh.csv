"At the end of this ""bagarre"" Alekhine is just a pawn up.

(as White) and Alekhine, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on a3"," After the recent game, Alekhine (Black) is only a pawn ahead. This pawn on f7 might seem like a small advantage, but it is significant. It's not just any pawn; it's supported by its own rook, making it more valuable than it appears. While the move might not guarantee a win for Black, it's a lesson in the subtle power of pawns in chess."
