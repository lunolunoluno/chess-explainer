"I'm surprised to see this move. I'd been thinking about it and then saw a game GM Yudasin - IM Nakamura from a recent event and now here it is again. White's idea is to not commit to d2-d4 and to perhaps threaten c2-c3, d2-d4 when he's used Bc4 to prevent the counter ...d6-d5. Black can easily play ...Ng8-f6 or ...Nb8-c6, but he must realize White's possible plan to achieve d2-d4, else he'll have no offensive potential.",True," The comment offers a plausible explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic analysis of White's potential plan.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This slows Black's pieces considerably. Be7 is plainly blocked by Pb4 and White's central pawns block Nd7. Ne1 is necessary to prevent ...Rc2.

"It appears he's repositioning to attack Pf7, but that's probably not true. Pf7 is very easily defended by Qd7. Instead he's probably aiming to play Be3-g5xe7 to weaken the dark squares.
