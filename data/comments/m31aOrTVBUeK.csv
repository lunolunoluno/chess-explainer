"Down at the Mexican Interzonal of 1985, Tal agreed to a Blitz match in which he overwhelmed me with many sharp sacrificial openings. I knew that 4.cxd5 cxd5 5.Nf3 e4 6.Ne5 was currently popular, but I also wanted to create something! At the very least I thought I'd surprise him!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because it describes the player's intentions and their awareness of popular moves, but does not provide specific details about the mistake made.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
If only because the game becomes so sharp.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only provides a brief observation about the nature of the game rather than addressing the specific move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
5...exd4?! 6.Nxd5 Nc6 7.Bb5 Bc5 8.Nf3 and White has an edge.,True,"

The comment correctly explains that the move 5...exd4?! was a mistake because after 6.Nxd5 Nc6, White gains an advantageous position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e4"
6.dxe5 Qxd1+ is duck soup for Tal.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting that allowing the move 6...Qxd1+ by White would be an extremely poor response for Black, akin to ""duck soup,"" indicating it's very easy for White to follow up with a winning move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5 with check"
6...Nd7? 7.dxe5 is better for White as as e5-e6 is in the air and Black's e-pawn is weak.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the vulnerability of Black's e-pawn and the tactical opportunity for White after 7.dxe5.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d7"
Another sharp alternative is 7.Qb3!? for example: 7...exd4 8.Bc4!? dxc3 9.Bxf7+ Ke7 10.Bxg8.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting a better alternative move that would have put the opponent in a difficult position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on e5"
"True to his nature, Tal keeps the tension, however I needed to win this final game and was worried whether I'd have much after 7...Bxb5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 9.Nxb5 Nc6 (9...Bb4+ 10.Bd2 Bxd2+ 11.Kxd2 Nc6 12.f4!? exf3 13.Nxf3 Ke7) 10.Bg5+ f6 11.0-0-0+ Kc8 12.exf6 Nxf6 13.Ne2 although this position is better for White.",True,"

The comment does explain the criticism because it points out that even though Tal's move kept the tension, the player needed to secure a win and this particular move didn't contribute to that goal.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"After some serious contemplation I noticed 8.Bf4 Nxe5? 9.Bxe5 Bxb5 10.Qxd8+ Rxd8 11.Nxb5 wins, but 8...Bb4 is OK for Black.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, which was allowing the pawn to capture the bishop early in the game.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d5"
"At the time I thought 8...Nb4 was best even though sometime during a restless night I analyzed the following in a drowsy state of semi-sleep: 8...Nb4 9.e6 (9.Qxe4 Bxb5 10.Nxb5 Rc8?? 11.Nd6+ Bxd6 12.exd6+ wins) 9...Nxd5 (9...Bxb5 10.Qxb5+ Nc6 11.Qxb7 Nge7 12.Nb5 winning) 10.Bxd7+ Ke7 11.Nxd5+ Kd6 12.Bf4+, and now: A) 12...Kc5 13.b4+ Kxd5 14.0-0-0+ Kc4 15.Ne2 Kxb4 (15...Bxb4 16.Rd4+ Kc5 17.Bd6+ Kb6 18.Rxb4+ looks winning) 16.Rd4+ Ka5 17.Ra4+ Kb6 18.Be3+ Kc7 19.Rc4+ with a promising attack, or; B) 12...Kxd5 13.0-0-0+ Kc5 (13...Kc4 14.b3+ Kb4 15.Rd4+ Kc5 16.Rc4+ Kd5 17.Ne2 Ba3+ 18.Kc2 Qxd7 19.exd7 Nf6 20.Rd1+ Ke6 21.Nd4+ Ke7 22.Nb5 wins) 14.Be3+ Kb4 15.Rd4+ Ka5 16.Ra4 mate.",True,"

The comment thoroughly explains the mistake made by the player due to late analysis in a semi-sleep state, revealing the mistakes in their previously played move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7"
"If 9...f5 10.0-0-0 0-0-0 11.Nge2?? Be6, therefore better is 11.Bc4 with an edge according to Tal.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the suggested move 11.Bc4 offers a better position according to the evaluation by Tal.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
"Risky, yet 11...0-0-0 12.Rc1! f5 13.exf6 favors White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as moving the rook to c1 allows Black to gain tempo with f5, which significantly improves their position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e5"
After 12...Qd6 13.Nf3 Bxb5 14.Nxe5 0-0-0 15.Rc1+ Kb8 16.Nd7+! Crunch!,True,"

The comment accurately describes the critical mistake, which is the premature castling move (0-0-0) after the queen's capture on b5, leading to a significant material deficit.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
Tempting is 13.Nxe7 fxe4 14.Nf5! yet I saw that after 14...Bf6 15.Nd6+ Ke7 16.Bxd7 Kxd6 17.0-0-0+ Ke7 18.Bf5 Nd3+ would give Tal some chances.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by explaining how the knight move (14.Nf5) could be met with a sequence of moves that leads to a winning position for Black, indicating the player's prior knowledge and foresight of potential counter-play.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"
If 13...Bxb5 14.Qxb5+ Qd7 15.Nc7+ wins.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it provides a sequence of moves that demonstrates why the move ""b5"" (presumably by Black) was a mistake, leading to a winning advantage for White.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2 Qd6,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d6"
If 14...Qxd5 15.Bxd7+ Qxd7 (if 15...Kxd7 16.Rd1 winning) 16.Nxe5 Qe7 17.0-0-0 with a raging attack as 17...Nf6 18.Qb5+ Kf8 19.Nd7+ Nxd7 20.Bd6 wins for White.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by outlining the potential winning tactics after 14...Qxd5, demonstrating the strategic blunder.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2 Qd6 14. Nf3 f4,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f4"
I had thought that 16.Bxf4 would be an error after 16...Bxb5 17.Qxb5+ Qc6! but I didn't have time to analyze 18.Qe2 0-0-0 19.Nxe5 Qxg2 20.Rc1+ which also wins.,True,"

The comment provides a detailed analysis of the mistake, explaining the consequences of the move 16.Bxf4 and why it was a poor choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2 Qd6 14. Nf3 f4 15. Nxf4 gxf4 16. Bxd7+,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on d7 with check"
Or 20...Qb6 21.Qd5+ etc.,True,"

The annotation comment highlights a poor move (20...Qb6) in the given position, suggesting there is a stronger alternative move (21.Qd5+) that the player should consider.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2 Qd6 14. Nf3 f4 15. Nxf4 gxf4 16. Bxd7+ Kxd7 17. Rd1 Nxf3+ 18. Qxf3 Re8+ 19. Kf1 Bd4 20. Bxf4 Qa6+,"This is a game between Browne,W (as White) and Tal,M (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a6 with check"
Black lost on time. Black overstepped in a hopeless position.,False,"

The comment makes an assertion that Black lost on time and overstepped in a hopeless position, but it does not specifically describe the move that was played, so it does not directly explain the mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e5 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. e4 dxe4 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. dxe5 Nc6 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 g5 10. Bg3 Bg7 11. Qxe4 Nxe5 12. Nd5 f5 13. Qe2 Qd6 14. Nf3 f4 15. Nxf4 gxf4 16. Bxd7+ Kxd7 17. Rd1 Nxf3+ 18. Qxf3 Re8+ 19.
