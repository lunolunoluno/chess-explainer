"This exchange on d5 often gives some initiative in such position, for it enables White to start a minority attack on the Queenside. The present position, however, is an exception which provides us with a welcome chance of giving a warning against superficial thinking. How is it that the minority attack give White such a promising initative in many variations of the QGD? The reason must be that the Pb4-b5 of the minority attack is a means of breaking the half-open c-file fully open. But this is not the whole explanation. The essential point is that Black, who has the half-open e-file, cannot be so prompt with his counterattack. His thematic advance is ... Pf5-f4, and this need preparation. Preparation however needs time, and White can use this time to push forward his b-pawn without delay. In light of these considerations the difference between the present diagram and the normal QG positions, in which the minority attack has legitimate expectations of success, is clear enough. Black has already played ... Pf5 and so will probably be able to play ... Pf4 before White can play Pb5 on the other flank.
