"Ponomariov's two previous games were decisive, so it will be interesting to see if he enters into complications or steers to a quiet draw. Ponomariov was ""odd man out"" round three and didn't play.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on Ponomariov's past performances and the potential strategies he might use in the current game rather than commenting on the specific move that was made.",1. e4,"This is a game between Ponomariov, Ruslan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
"It hasn't been that long ago players wouldn't play 3...e5. It was feared White could use the c4-f7 diagonal. But, in the past year or so 3...e5 has been seen quite a few times. For the time being f2-f4 is blocked by Nf3 and Black's pawns prevent d2-d4, so White will necessarily lose time reorganizing. In the long run Black's weak d5 may tell, but he should be able to develop pieces actively.",True,"

The comment explains the move's mistake by discussing the potential weakness in Black's position and the lack of immediate threats from White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5,"This is a game between Ponomariov, Ruslan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
"He is trading his ""bad bishop"" (the one which clashes with his central pawns) for a White knight which might maneuver Nd2-f1-e3-d5. Whether this is necessary isn't clear, but it is consistent positional play.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the trade of a ""bad bishop"" for a knight, which could be seen as a mistake due to the potential benefits of maintaining the bishop's influence over central squares. The explanation of the knight's potential maneuvering also adds insight into why the move might be questionable.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+,"This is a game between Ponomariov, Ruslan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on d2 with check"
"I'm not certain I like this move, but ...Ng8-e7 has some problems too. Qd8 needs room to move, to give Ke8 an option to O-O-O. That means he needs ...Bc8-e6 and perhaps ...Qd8-d7. It's not clear what's required and what's optional here. After all, after the game move White can't maintain a pin on Nf6 with 9. Bg5 in light of 9...h6.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the need for space on the queenside for Black's king to castle and the potential weaknesses of placing the bishop on c8 after a certain move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6,"This is a game between Ponomariov, Ruslan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
Now that White has the two bishops v. two knights he decides to regain one of them. Though his position is fine it's hard to know how valuable those bishops might become later.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as losing a bishop (and potentially other valuable pieces) without gaining a significant advantage in return is often considered a poor move in chess.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. Bxd5 h6,"This is a game between Ponomariov, Ruslan (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
"With this move Black doesn't commit himself to a queen-side action, but he certainly makes it clear White's bishop is a target.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it identifies a strategic weakness in Black's position, potentially leading to loss of material or a disadvantageous position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. Bxd5 h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13.

"Now Black's ready for ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 to squeeze White's queen-side, particularly the bishop, and perhaps to gain control of which files might open for rooks.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as it suggests a plan for exploiting White's weaknesses on the queen-side, which is a logical continuation from a poorly played move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. Bxd5 h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Qd2 Ne7 14.

"This move surprises me completely. I'd have thought he was happy with the cooperation of his Ne7 with the dark-square pawns. He must be thinking Kf1 is uncomfortable and White's rooks are split, so he should go right down the middle at Qd2 (e.g. ...d6-d5xe4) .",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player likely thought advancing the d-pawn to d5 would be a strong central move, but it overlooks potential tactics and threats from the opponent's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. Bxd5 h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Qd2 Ne7 14. Bc4 O-O 15.

smashing through at the cost of a pawn or two. Will Black get to Kf1? A more cautious player might take time for ...Re8-e7 to defend the rook (Re7) and Pb7.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by highlighting the potential loss of material and suggesting a more cautious move to defend the rook and pawn.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. Bxd5 h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Qd2 Ne7 14. Bc4 O-O 15. Kf1 Rad8 16. Re1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Qe2 Rfe8 19. Qe4 Nb6 20.

Leaving Black's pawn on the board is probably more dangerous than exposing the king further to checks.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake as it highlights the strategic importance of a pawn in chess, which can often be more critical to defend than the king in certain positions.",1. e4 c5 2.

and White (or is it Black) must concede to a draw by perpetual check after 28. Rh3 Qf4+ 29. Rg3 ( 29. g3?? Qf2# ) Qh4+ ( 29...Rxh1+ 30. Kxh1 Qxf4 should be good for White because Pc4 is passed and Pa7 about to fall ) =,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a potential perpetual check sequence that could force a draw for the player who didn't make the move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6.
