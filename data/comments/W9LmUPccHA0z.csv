1. e4,"Ponomariov's two previous games were decisive, so it will be interesting to see if he enters into complications or steers to a quiet draw. Ponomariov was ""odd man out"" round three and didn't play.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5,"It hasn't been that long ago players wouldn't play 3...e5. It was feared White could use the c4-f7 diagonal. But, in the past year or so 3...e5 has been seen quite a few times. For the time being f2-f4 is blocked by Nf3 and Black's pawns prevent d2-d4, so White will necessarily lose time reorganizing. In the long run Black's weak d5 may tell, but he should be able to develop pieces actively.",False
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+,"He is trading his ""bad bishop"" (the one which clashes with his central pawns) for a White knight which might maneuver Nd2-f1-e3-d5. Whether this is necessary isn't clear, but it is consistent positional play.",True
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Bc4 d6 5. d3 Be7 6. Nd2 Bg5 7. h4 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Nf6,"I'm not certain I like this move, but ...Ng8-e7 has some problems too. Qd8 needs room to move, to give Ke8 an option to O-O-O. That means he needs ...Bc8-e6 and perhaps ...Qd8-d7. It's not clear what's required and what's optional here. After all, after the game move White can't maintain a pin on Nf6 with 9. Bg5 in light of 9...h6.",True

Bxd5 h6,Now that White has the two bishops v. two knights he decides to regain one of them. Though his position is fine it's hard to know how valuable those bishops might become later.,False

Kf1 Rad8,"This move surprises me completely. I'd have thought he was happy with the cooperation of his Ne7 with the dark-square pawns. He must be thinking Kf1 is uncomfortable and White's rooks are split, so he should go right down the middle at Qd2 (e.g. ...d6-d5xe4) .",True
