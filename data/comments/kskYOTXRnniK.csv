D13: Slav Defence: Exchange variation without ...Bf5,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it merely describes the Slav Defense exchange variation without mentioning the specific error or consequences of the move.",1. d4,"This is a game between Portisch, L. (as White) and Kramnik, V. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
Controls b5,False,"

The comment ""controls b5"" does not explain the mistake, as it only describes a potential positional advantage rather than the error in the move itself.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5.

Consolidates g4,True,"

The comment ""Consolidates g4"" implies that the move was an attempt to strengthen the pawn structure or create a pawn chain beginning at g4, but it does not directly explain a mistake made by the player.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9. Be2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Bf5 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Qe2 a6 15. h3,"This is a game between Portisch, L. (as White) and Kramnik, V.

The rook intends Rc1-c3-c7-c5,True,"
The comment correctly identifies the rook's potential movement pattern that could lead to a loss of material.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9.

An ideal square for the white rook.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it is praising a move rather than critiquing a mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9.

Plans Rxc5. The knight dominates,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake because placing the knight on c5 would create a strong attacking presence, dominating the center of the board and posing threats to the opponent's pieces.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9. Be2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Bf5 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Qe2 a6 15. h3 Na5 16. Bd3 Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Qd7 18. Rc3 b5 19. Rfc1 Nc4 20. Qe2 Nb6 21.

The comment implies that the move made by the player was a blunder, as it didn't address an immediate threat or create a tangible benefit for Black.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9. Be2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Bf5 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Qe2 a6 15. h3 Na5 16. Bd3 Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Qd7 18. Rc3 b5 19. Rfc1 Nc4 20. Qe2 Nb6 21.

Threatens Ne2,True,"
The comment correctly identifies a potential mistake by not adequately defending the knight on e2, which could be targeted by the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9. Be2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Bf5 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Qe2 a6 15. h3 Na5 16. Bd3 Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Qd7 18. Rc3 b5 19. Rfc1 Nc4 20. Qe2 Nb6 21. Rc7 Qe6 22.

Black threatens strongly Bxa1,True,"

Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bf4 Ne4 7. e3 Nxc3 8. bxc3 g6 9. Be2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Bf5 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Qe2 a6 15. h3 Na5 16. Bd3 Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Qd7 18. Rc3 b5 19. Rfc1 Nc4 20. Qe2 Nb6 21.
