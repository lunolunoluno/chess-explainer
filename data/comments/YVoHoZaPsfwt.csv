(as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"

Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. O-O-O Bb7 10. g4 Nb6 11. Qf2 Nfd7 12. Bd3 Rc8 13. Nce2 Be7 14. h4 O-O 15. Kb1 Na4 16. g5,"This is a game between Polgar, Ju (as White) and Kasparov, G. (as Black).

Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. O-O-O Bb7 10. g4 Nb6 11. Qf2 Nfd7 12. Bd3 Rc8 13. Nce2 Be7 14. h4 O-O 15. Kb1 Na4 16. g5 Ndc5 17. Ng3 Qc7 18. Nb3 d5 19. e5 Qxe5 20. Bd4 Qc7 21. f4 Ne4 22.

Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. O-O-O Bb7 10. g4 Nb6 11. Qf2 Nfd7 12. Bd3 Rc8 13. Nce2 Be7 14. h4 O-O 15. Kb1 Na4 16. g5 Ndc5 17. Ng3 Qc7 18. Nb3 d5 19. e5 Qxe5 20. Bd4 Qc7 21. f4 Ne4 22.
