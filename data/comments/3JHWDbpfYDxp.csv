"I don't recall Polgar having a very good record against Karpov, so it will be interesting to see what she has planned for this encounter.",False,"

The comment is focusing on the players' past records and does not address the quality of the move itself.",1. Nf3 Nf6,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6",-
"I suppose the first curiousity is that Karpov isn't playing 1. d4, his standard opening.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the quality of the move played; it only mentions that Karpov has deviated from his standard opening, which does not necessarily imply a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4",-
and Polgar isn't playing a King's Indian Defense set-up!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only states that Polgar is not playing a King's Indian Defense set-up, which does not necessarily indicate whether the move was incorrect or why it was incorrect.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6",-
This often leads to Black playing a Tarrasch Defense with ...d7-d5 or perhaps a Hedgehog formation after d2-d4 and ...cxd4.,False,"

"The Tarrasch (or Semi-Tarrasch, which Bobby Fischer occasionally played) isn't considered to be fully equalizing, but it's not as bad against e2-e3 as against g2-g3.",False,"

The comment explains the decision to play the Tarrasch Opening, but it does not directly address why the move might have been considered a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5",-

"perhaps threatening ...Bxh3, especially if Nf3 should move",True,"
The comment accurately highlights the potential mistake made by the player, suggesting that the move ""...Bxh3"" may have been a blunder, especially if the move Nf3 was considered as an alternative.",1.

Is he aiming for Ne2-g3 to chase away Bf5 or Ne2-d4 to pressure Nc6?,True,"

Explanation: The comment is analyzing the potential strategic purpose behind the move Ne2, which helps understand why it might have been a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black).

"hoping to get rid of Ng3, but also defending Bc5 to keep the c-file safely closed until Pc6 can be resupported again",True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic reasoning behind the move, explaining the intent to defend the c-file while also considering the need to support the bishop on c5.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4"," Black's move to e4 with the Knight is not optimal. They aim to eliminate Ng3, but this neglects the need to secure the c-file, which will be crucial until they can support Pc6 again."
"Black's formation looks well-coordinated and safe, but I don't see any easy offensive.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by indicating that although the position is safe, there are no clear opportunities for Black to attack or gain material advantage.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16.

Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6"," Black's formation appears solid and secure, yet lacking immediate striking opportunities."
threatening Qxg7#,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the potential to deliver checkmate with Qxg7#.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d4", White's move Qd4 is not an immediate threat of Qxg7# because Black has not made the critical move necessary for this to be a threat.
Karpov prefers to build the pressure rather than simplifying.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as Karpov's preference for building pressure over simplifying indicates that the player likely missed the opportunity to capitalize on the weaker position and instead prolonged the game unnecessarily.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18.

Last move played: White plays Knight to d4"," White opts for aggressive play, placing more emphasis on building up pressure."
"White has seen a variation where he can discoordinate Black, just enough to get at Pc5.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out a tactical opportunity where White can exploit Black's mistake to gain control over a key square.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18. Rac1 Qd7 19. Qa4 Nc5 20.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"," White's last move potentially creates a positional weakness in Black's camp, specifically targeting the Pc5 pawn."
and Nc5 can be supported with b3-b4; but wouldn't the c-file pin still be difficult for White if Black can bring Ng3 back?,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it addresses the potential issue of the c-file pin for White after Black's knight maneuvering.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18. Rac1 Qd7 19. Qa4 Nc5 20.

Last move played: White plays Knight takes on c5"," The move Nc5 by White would be less effective because it leaves the c-file pin vulnerable, especially if Black can reposition the knight to Ng3."
"What's this? exd4 obviously enables ...Ng3-e2+, but what happens after e3-e4?",True,"

The comment accurately points out the tactical error in the move, as it allows the opponent's knight to invade the e2 square, and questions the follow-up move e3-e4, hinting at possible counterplay.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18.

Nxc5 d4,"This is a game between Karpov, Anatoly (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d4"," Black's pawn to d4 allows White's pawn to capture en passant. Considering White's next move, e3-e4, Black must carefully consider their response, as it could lead to a disadvantageous position."
Can this wild pawn really do damage? It supports ...Ng3-e2+ and it's not so easily avoided. This is a rather amazing tactical turn-of-events; just when it looked like Karpov had secured a pawn and a completely safe position.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the tactical opportunity missed due to the premature pawn push and the subsequent threats posed by the opponent's piece maneuver.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18.

It's an unexpected maneuver given the previous positioning, turning the game into a fascinating tactical battle."
Rather than lose quickly he decides to take the second pawn and try to survive the ending.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as they sacrificed the pawn in an attempt to prolong the game and potentially turn the tide.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18. Rac1 Qd7 19. Qa4 Nc5 20.

"This poses Black a very difficult problem: is ...Nh1 safe, is ...Rd7 sufficient; just how can she get Ng3 out of danger.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only raises questions about Black's subsequent moves without addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1.

This is a kind of compensation for White too; Nh1 isn't able to do much damage for several moves.,True,"

This comment explains the mistake as it suggests that the move ""Nh1"" (Knight to h1) for White is not a strong strategic decision and won't have a significant impact in the game for several moves.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. O-O O-O 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. h3 Bf5 11. b3 Qd7 12. Ne2 a6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ng3 Ne4 15. Nxf5 Qxf5 16. Bb2 Bd6 17. Qd4 f6 18.

threatening g2-g4 and Rc2-h2 to win the piece,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a strategic mistake by suggesting a tactical opportunity to win material through a pawn move and a rook maneuver.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Well, the knight is back in play, but White's getting a third pawn for the bishop and with two connected passed queen-side pawns he would seem to be in good shape.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by White, as it highlights the weakness introduced by the knight's move, which resulted in a third pawn having to be traded and the creation of two connected passed pawns on the queenside.",1.

Amazingly this is forced because Ba3 was completely stuck. This game is full of some rather amazing coincidences and rejoinders.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as Ba3 was a forced move and the game indeed had a series of surprising moves.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
