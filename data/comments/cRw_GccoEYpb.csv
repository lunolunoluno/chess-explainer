"Again, as in several other games of this tournament, Polgar uses another pawn to restrain her opponent's pieces. This one is recognized as fully appropriate for this position.

"This is a well-placed piece to limit White's options. If Pf4 advances then ...Nd7-e5 is terrific. However, if White can create a second threat to go along with f4-f5 then White can still make progress. If White does nothing immediate then Black might consider ...Nd7-c5 to pressure Pe4, but he has to be cognizant of the fact White might use b2-b4 at any moment to chase Nc5 away; so, timing is important. To that end people have often played ...Ra8-c8, ...Qd8-c7-b8-a8 to add more pressure to Pe4. The danger of that is to find Qa8 too far from the king-side to assist in any defensive measures.",True," The comment offers strategic insights into a potential weakness in White's plan, suggesting a reactive approach that could be detrimental.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This probably indicates she wants to move Bf2, but doesn't want to retreat Nd4-e2 where it would block Re1 from defending Pe4. This indicates the difficulty of trying to maintain a static position, rather than carrying out a dynamic plan leading to some positive action. And, after all, what is Nb3 doing? It might have participated in king-side play, but it doesn't seem likely now. Also, without Nd4 the dark-square diagonal is weaker and Bg7 better.",True," The comment offers insightful analysis of strategic considerations and potential weaknesses in the player's plan, suggesting a flawed approach.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Black controls more central squares and probably plans ...Nf6-d7, where it's more centrally located and can move to e5 or f8 and it controls e5.",True," The comment suggests Black's central control is a weakness, potentially leading to a tactical blunder.",1. e4 c5 2.

"opening the b-file and possibly preparing ...Re8-d8, ...Qc7-b7 to continue pressuring Pe4",True," The comment suggests a potential tactical error by moving the bishop to the b-file, which is a common mistake in the opening.",1. e4 c5 2.

"threatening ...Nxf2 and trying to divert Qf3, so he can capture Nc3 to ""own"" the diagonal and, in particular, d4. It's hard to criticize this move because it is done with good intentions, but Polgar's reply does make it appear to be a mistake. It's just terribly unobvious.",True," The comment identifies a potential mistake and suggests Polgar's response indicates a flaw, suggesting the move is questionable.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This move might be a mistake except for the fact that in the endgame it's alright to trade the king-side pawns for Black's queen-side pawns. The better-formed queen-side pawns, if unblocked, are better. It's a curious thing also that there are times when a rook and knight work better together than a rook and bishop, so Black's Bg7 might be valued highly at the moment, but only a few moves from now the knight could be better!",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic consideration of pawn structure and piece activity.",1. e4 c5 2.

"a very awkward place for a rook. It's hard to say whether this gives up the win or if it's still there.
