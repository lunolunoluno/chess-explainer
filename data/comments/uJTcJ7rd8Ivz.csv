D48: Semi-Slav: Meran System: 7...b5 8 Bd3 a6,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it identifies the opening system (Semi-Slav Defense) and the specific position (Meran System) where the move 7...b5 8 Bd3 a6 deviates from the traditional line, indicating the player's error.",1. d4,"This is a game between Kasparov, G. (as White) and Kramnik, V. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4", The move 7...b5 by Black was not strong because it weakens their pawn structure and cedes control of the center without gaining significant positional advantages.
last book move,True,"

The comment ""last book move"" suggests that the player made a mistake by following a well-known, textbook move that was not suitable for the current situation, hence explaining the mistake made.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

""White's last move (Kasparov) placed their Bishop on d6, which doesn't significantly improve their position or create any immediate threats. This move appears to give Black (Kramnik) an opportunity to solidify their defensive setup."""
Do you see the mate threat?,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely questions whether the opponent notices a checkmate threat, not addressing any specific error in the move played.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

Eliminates the defender f3,False,"

The comment does not adequately explain the mistake, as it does not specify which piece is attacking or what the consequences of the move are.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6.

Threatening mate: Bb5,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only mentions the potential threat of mate but does not address the specific error in the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.

(as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c6",-
Plans Qd2,True,"

The comment ""Plans Qd2"" suggests that the player's move was a mistake because it references a future move (placing the queen on d2) without considering the current state of the game, indicating a lack of strategic planning.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 8. Bd3 Bb7 9. O-O a6 10. e4 c5 11. d5 c4 12. Bc2 Qc7 13. Nd4 Nc5 14. b4 cxb3 15. axb3 b4 16. Na4 Ncxe4 17.
