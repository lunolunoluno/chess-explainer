"Very suspicious looking at first sight, but black will not necessarily castle kingside, and he hopes to control the dark-squares and keep the initiative. The f8-bishop is prepared to fianchetto without losing time. By the way, these are just my observations and, be as they may, the opening has gone respectable in the last few years.",True," The comment offers potential strategic insights into the move's weaknesses, suggesting a challenging position for the opponent.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Excellent. White grabs control of d5, and completely destroys the potential of black's center pawns. By the way I like this move for another reason... it fits in with my reaction theory (which is just an expanded version of something Motwani describes in S.T.A.R.
