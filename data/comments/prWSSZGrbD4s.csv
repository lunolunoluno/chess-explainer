"Very suspicious looking at first sight, but black will not necessarily castle kingside, and he hopes to control the dark-squares and keep the initiative. The f8-bishop is prepared to fianchetto without losing time. By the way, these are just my observations and, be as they may, the opening has gone respectable in the last few years.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it provides a strategic analysis of the position, suggesting alternative plans and highlighting potential weaknesses in the move played.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5,"This is a game between Anand, Vishy (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
"Instead of trying to detonate the position, white has found an efficient way to deploy his pieces based on challenging the a1-h8 diagonal with a gain of time.",False,"

The comment does not seem to explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a missed opportunity to advance rather than highlighting a potential error in the move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Bg7 10. Be2 h5 11. Bxg4,"This is a game between Anand, Vishy (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on g4"
"Remember that in last week's game black played 11...hxg4. The bishop recapture certainly appears more natural, however, and I think that you have to know this game to understand why someone would take with the pawn.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights the standard strategic choice (bishop recapture) and suggests that understanding the specific game scenario is necessary to appreciate why the player chose the pawn capture instead.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Bg7 10. Be2 h5 11. Bxg4 Bxg4,"This is a game between Anand, Vishy (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on g4"
Notice that white deliberately delayed queenside castling for this manuever.,True,"

The comment clearly highlights a strategic mistake by the white player of delaying castling, which could have left their king vulnerable to attacks.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

Intending 25. Nb4.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it indicates a lack of foresight and understanding of the position, suggesting the player was planning to make an ineffective move with 25. Nb4.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Bg7 10. Be2 h5 11. Bxg4 Bxg4 12. f3 Bd7 13. Bf2 Nc6 14. Qd2 Ne5 15. b3 e6 16. Nde2 Rc8 17. Bd4 b5 18.

"This one must have really hurt to play, as black's position depends on active pieces to compensate for the structural weaknesses.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move led to structural weaknesses, requiring active pieces to compensate, indicating a significant blunder.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Bg7 10. Be2 h5 11. Bxg4 Bxg4 12. f3 Bd7 13. Bf2 Nc6 14. Qd2 Ne5 15. b3 e6 16. Nde2 Rc8 17. Bd4 b5 18. Nd1 Rg8 19. Ne3 a5 20. O-O-O a4 21.

"Finally giving white a fresh complex of pawn weaknesses, which he latches onto within the next few moves.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as creating pawn weaknesses for the opponent can lead to significant tactical and positional vulnerabilities that the opponent can exploit.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Bg7 10. Be2 h5 11. Bxg4 Bxg4 12. f3 Bd7 13. Bf2 Nc6 14. Qd2 Ne5 15. b3 e6 16. Nde2 Rc8 17. Bd4 b5 18. Nd1 Rg8 19.

"Excellent. White grabs control of d5, and completely destroys the potential of black's center pawns. By the way I like this move for another reason... it fits in with my reaction theory (which is just an expanded version of something Motwani describes in S.T.A.R. Chess) - see the first Rubinstein game I annotated for details. Basically this is a reaction to 29...f6.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it seems to praise and justify the move rather than explain the error.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 7.

"Black resigned. 39... Bf8, while objectively toughest, would have been very dismal, while 39... exf5 goes down in flames. Normally, one would play either line out, but this just wasn't Kasparov's day.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player; it only states the outcome and potential moves without analyzing the reason behind the mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.
