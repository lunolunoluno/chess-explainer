"This is the Philidor Defense with some unusual lines. 3. Bc4 is perfectly all right, but 3. d4! offers much more possibilities. This is an opening where white can get a big advantage in the center if black's not careful. The first way to get an advantage was to play 3. d4. Again 3.

"Not the best choice in opening lines. It brings the queen's bishop out much too early. The simple 3. Be7 or 3. Nc6 would've sufficed.

"Some masters of the past have tried this, but with not much success. This pin is not very strong at all. There's no need to immediately tickle it with h3.

"Bad, once again, due to the fact it leaves the knight poorly protected (in the short term) and the bishop has nothing to contribute to the game from that closed diagonal (long term) unless a center break would occur.

You don't want to commit your king until the center is defined and you have no weaknesses (g6 is your weakness here). 9. Nd7 or 9. c6 immediately would be indicated.

"A decent developing move. However, an attack on the wing can't beat a counterattack in the center. 10. Nd7 isn't the most forcing.
