To transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted at this point has it's interesting points. For one White can't continue with an immediate e2-e4.

"Ivanchuk avoids complications stemming from 4. Nc3 a6 and just regains the pawn. He's also left Nb1, so as to not get in the way of his queen. If there's a Nc3 and Qc4 (after regaining the pawn) it can be awkward.",True," The comment suggests a potential tactical disadvantage stemming from a specific pawn structure, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. d4 d5 2.

"Ponomariov is aiming for completely free and easy development with no pawn weaknesses. There is a similar variation in the Catalan opening, but in that one White gets in Nf3-e5xc6 to force tripled pawns on Black. Here White will have to develop solidly and yet threaten to meet such moves as ...e7-e5 with d4-d5 to cramp Black. The battle is on!",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic plan based on tactical possibilities.",1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4.

This is sort of nifty.

"Ponomariov's strategy for this game seems to be eXtreme piece activity with very few pawn moves, giving Ivanchuk no time to use his pawns or to build up any kind of pressure. At the first sign of that sort of thing Ponomariov has gone for exchanges.",True," The comment accurately describes a potential weakness in Ponomariov's strategy, suggesting a lack of development and pawn structure.",1. d4 d5 2.

"Ivanchuk could continue, despite this not being his kind of position, but it would be difficult to achieve anything, even if White gave back the pawn. Black's piece activity and immediate threats to Pa3 & Pc3 makes it difficult for White to make even one free offensive move. These two creep forward and are tied with Anand for 2nd-4th, now one full point behind Kasparov (who beat Vallejo Pons this round) .",True," The comment highlights strategic weaknesses and the impact of opponent activity, suggesting the move was a mistake.",1. d4 d5 2.
