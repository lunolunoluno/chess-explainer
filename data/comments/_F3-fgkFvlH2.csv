1. d4 d5,Ponomariov generally plays either the King's Indian Defense or the Queen's Gambit Accepted against 1. d4.,False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4,To transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted at this point has it's interesting points. For one White can't continue with an immediate e2-e4. Black also doesn't have to worry about the double attack which would result from the move-sequence 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 a6 4. Bxc4 b5?? 5. Qf3 because there's a Nf3.,True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+,"Ivanchuk avoids complications stemming from 4. Nc3 a6 and just regains the pawn. He's also left Nb1, so as to not get in the way of his queen. If there's a Nc3 and Qc4 (after regaining the pawn) it can be awkward.",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6,"Ponomariov is aiming for completely free and easy development with no pawn weaknesses. There is a similar variation in the Catalan opening, but in that one White gets in Nf3-e5xc6 to force tripled pawns on Black. Here White will have to develop solidly and yet threaten to meet such moves as ...e7-e5 with d4-d5 to cramp Black. The battle is on!",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5,This is sort of nifty. He's trying to get rid of a pair of minor pieces before White can utilize his extra central pawn to cramp him.,False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5 6. Qxc4 Nb6,I don't understand. How could the knight be better on b6 than f6? Why not trade at c3?,False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5 6. Qxc4 Nb6 7. Qb3 e5,Black isn't going to delay the development of his pieces! This takes unreal confidence or large doses of courage.,True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5 6. Qxc4 Nb6 7. Qb3 e5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Qc2 Nd4 10. Qd3 Bc5,This makes ...Be6-c4 possible.,False
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5 6. Qxc4 Nb6 7. Qb3 e5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Qc2 Nd4 10. Qd3 Bc5 11. e3 Nxf3+ 12. gxf3 Qxd3 13. Bxd3 O-O-O 14. Be2 Bb4 15. Bd2 Na4,"Quickly, before White can castle and bring rooks into play, the Nc3 and it's supporters (Bd2 and Pb2) are threatened.",True
1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Qa4+ Nc6 5. Nc3 Nd5 6. Qxc4 Nb6 7. Qb3 e5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Qc2 Nd4 10. Qd3 Bc5 11. e3 Nxf3+ 12. gxf3 Qxd3 13. Bxd3 O-O-O 14. Be2 Bb4 15. Bd2 Na4 16. a3 Bxc3 17. Bxc3 Nxc3 18. bxc3 Rd5,"Ponomariov's strategy for this game seems to be eXtreme piece activity with very few pawn moves, giving Ivanchuk no time to use his pawns or to build up any kind of pressure. At the first sign of that sort of thing Ponomariov has gone for exchanges.",False

Bxc3 Nxc3 18. bxc3 Rd5 19. f4 Rc5 20. Rc1,"Ivanchuk could continue, despite this not being his kind of position, but it would be difficult to achieve anything, even if White gave back the pawn. Black's piece activity and immediate threats to Pa3 & Pc3 makes it difficult for White to make even one free offensive move. These two creep forward and are tied with Anand for 2nd-4th, now one full point behind Kasparov (who beat Vallejo Pons this round) .",True
