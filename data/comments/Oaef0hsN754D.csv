(Early departure from the usual. what's he up to.),True,"

The comment suggests that the move deviates from standard opening principles, which may indicate a mistake.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on f3"
"(Ah, pawn grabbing. But in common with a number of opening situations, there's a downside. Black cannot hold onto the material without suffering positionally. Capturing by 6...Nxd4 allows 7.Bd5 and there are a surprising number of tricks in that line to keep White happy.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential consequences of the pawn capture.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on d4"
"(White reje cts 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qb3+ e6 as there is greater scope for Black to muddy the waters. retaining the threatening Bishop, and indeed the Bishop pair, looked better. blacks responce defends the attacked pawns but clutters his back rank with non-participants. A developing move at the cost of a pawn was advisable.)",True,"

The comment accurately pinpoints the mistake made by White, highlighting the missed opportunity to retain the threatening Bishop and the Bishop pair, and instead opting for a pawn move that defended the attacked pawns but cluttered the back rank.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d8"
(White takes advantage of the Queen and deploys the second Bishop. 8.Nb5 Qe5+ doesn't look so convincing. Black's retreat may have been too orientated towards stopping Nb5. 8...Qf6 may have been a lesser evil.),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the vulnerability created by the move and suggests a better alternative for Black's response.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7"
#(Again White can bring more firepower to bear at the expence of the Queen's vulnerable position. the reply 9...Qf5 may have been tried but that White Knight would be ready to spring to b5 again.),True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting that White sacrificed material by placing the Queen in a vulnerable position with the intention of gaining tactical advantage.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c8"
"(With such a lead in development and potential to embarrass the King, I was happy to give up the Rook for the poor defending Knight. 10...Qxd8? 11.Bxf7+ Kd7 12.Qe6++.)",True,"

The comment highlights the critical mistake of trading a Rook for a Knight when the Rook had a strong position on the board, and the Knight's defensive capability is insufficient to compensate for the loss.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King takes on d8"
(White's Bishop imposes a blockade as well as driving away the Queen. 12...Nd7 would invite 13.0-0 with Rd1 to follow.),True,"

The comment accurately explains that Black's move 12...Nd7 weakens their position by allowing White to follow up with 13.0-0, leading to a potential threat against the Black King with Rd1.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b8"
"(White was intent on using the d file for attacking and so it seemed the King on e8 would stop Black's Knight from redeploying via that square onto d6. However 13.Bf4 is unpleasant, as in 13...Ne8 14.Qa4 Nf6 15.Nd5.)",True,"

The comment accurately identifies why 13.Bf4 can be considered a mistake, explaining that Black's Knight can reposition to defend the central d6 square, potentially leading to a strong position for Black.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to e8"
"(With the same intent, White wants to get the Rook available for the d file but even here 14.Bf4 is good.)",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it seems to justify the move 14.Bf4 instead of pointing out its suboptimal nature.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8 14. O-O g6,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"
(Despite the slower than necessary build-up White can now finish off. 15...Bg7 was another try but 16.Bh6 exposes the shortcomings of the Black position. (16. ..Bxh6 17.Nxf6+).),True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made, highlighting that the player's move 15...Bg7 was an attempt to solidify their position but ultimately led to an exposed weakness that White could exploit with 16.Bh6.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8 14. O-O g6 15. Ne4 Qd8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d8"
(Again 16...Bg7 prolongs matters.),True,"

The comment accurately highlights that the move 16...Bg7 is considered a mistake as it further delays the player's development instead of actively improving their position.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8 14. O-O g6 15. Ne4 Qd8 16. Qb3 Qb8,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b8"
"(Not bad, but innacurate as 18.Qd3+ is quicker. (18...Nd7 19.Nc5 Qc8 20.Ne6++.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the move 18.Qd3+ is indeed a slower alternative compared to 18...Nd7 followed by a series of quicker tactical responses.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8 14. O-O g6 15. Ne4 Qd8 16. Qb3 Qb8 17. Bf7+ Kd8 18. Rd1+,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to d1 with check"
"(The ""flashy"" 20.Nf6 works just as well. black tried to hold onto material for too long. The resulting positional difficulties brought on by underdevelopment and allowing the Queen to be harrassed, were too great even to survive some inefficiant latter moves by White.)",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the consequences of the move, such as underdevelopment, positional difficulties, and the Queen being harassed, which ultimately led to Black's inability to hold onto material.",1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nc6 3. c4 Bg4 4. Nc3 Bxf3 5. exf3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Qxd4 7. Qb3 Nd8 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Rd1 Qc8 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bxf7 Nf6 12. Be6 Qb8 13. Qd1+ Ke8 14. O-O g6 15. Ne4 Qd8 16. Qb3 Qb8 17. Bf7+ Kd8 18. Rd1+ Nd7 19. Qd5 Qc8 20. Nc5,"This is a game between Salter, David (as White) and Rutherford, Jim (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c5"
