Nc3 c6 4. Nf3 d6 5. h3,"This is a game between Knox, A. (as White) and Lloyd, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3", Knox's attempt to consolidate g4 is not advisable.

Nf3 d6 5. h3 Na6 6. a3 Nc7 7. Be3 e6 8. Qd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxd5 cxd5 11. Bd3 Qb6 12. c3 Bd7 13. Ne5 Bb5 14. Bxb5+ Qxb5 15. h4 Nf6 16. f3,"This is a game between Knox, A. (as White) and Lloyd, G.

The mate threat is Qxf7 and is easily defended.,True,"

Nf3 d6 5. h3 Na6 6. a3 Nc7 7. Be3 e6 8. Qd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxd5 cxd5 11. Bd3 Qb6 12. c3 Bd7 13. Ne5 Bb5 14. Bxb5+ Qxb5 15. h4 Nf6 16. f3 h6 17. Ng4 Nxg4 18. fxg4 Qc4 19. Rf1 Rd8 20. Qf2,"This is a game between Knox, A. (as White) and Lloyd, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to f2", Black's queen move to f2 is not optimal; it doesn't address the mate threat which could be easily countered by their pieces.
"At this point White seems to have the advantage, however you have to press it home or it can soon slip away!!",True,"

but even a better move would not have saved the game.,True,"
