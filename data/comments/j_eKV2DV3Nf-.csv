"15...Qe7 is the more popular alternative, however by playing rare line in a sub-variation I may surprise my opponent. Afterwards Rizzitano told me that he had several games with this position I didn't even know!",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it simply provides a rationale for their choice to play an uncommon line in a sub-variation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

"After 16.Rg1 I played the novelty 16...h6! in the game Wolff-Browne, World Open 1989, which I managed to win in a very exciting ending.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by acknowledging that the move 16...h6 was a novelty that the player attempted to win with, indicating a recognition of the unconventional nature of the move.",1. e4 c5 2.

The most critical line. After 17...0-0 Black concedes a slight edge to White.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the player's mistake as giving their opponent a slight edge after 17...0-0.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9.

I have to move my king off the f-line sooner or later.,False,"
The comment doesn't directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it's a general statement about king safety rather than specific advice related to the move in question.",1. e4 c5 2.

"A very important move which underlines my strategy to control the f-line. On c8, the rook would be subject to attack via h3, not to mention the fact that Black can't hope for any real pressure on c2.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the strategic importance of controlling the f-line and the vulnerability of the rook on c8 in the context of the opponent's potential attack via h3 and the lack of pressure on c2.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. f5 Bxg5+ 14. Kb1 Ne5 15. Qh5 Qd8 16.

"White correctly neutralizes my pressure on the file, but he can't claim any advantage and we both had over 4 minutes left!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on the time remaining rather than the potential strategic mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.

The bishop is worse on g4 than on e6.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it compares the bishop's position on two different squares rather than evaluating the consequences of the move itself.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to f8",-
"A wonderful all-purpose move! Firstly, I want to play Rf8-f2, but this is almost a misdirection as the Black queen will enter the game powerfully on g5.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, noting that aiming to play Rf8-f2 is a misdirection and the Black queen's potential move to g5 will significantly impact the game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. f5 Bxg5+ 14. Kb1 Ne5 15. Qh5 Qd8 16.

The idea of Qg5-d2xh2 can't be adequately repulsed as 29.Qe2 allows 29...Qg1+ and 29.Qd1 runs into 29...Nc4.,True,"

The comment appropriately explains the mistake as it highlights the potential threats (Qg1+ and Nc4) that arise from the proposed move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.

White's best chance.,False,"

The comment ""White's best chance"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move was potentially advantageous, but does not address why it was a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

Threat on threat it seems. however once again the other idea or Qg5-e5 is a killer.,True,"

The comment adequately explains the mistake, as it highlights the player's misstep by focusing on a more dangerous alternative move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. f5 Bxg5+ 14. Kb1 Ne5 15. Qh5 Qd8 16. Nxe6 Bxe6 17. fxe6 g6 18. exf7+ Kxf7 19. Qe2 Kg7 20. Nd5 Ra7 21. Bh3 Rf8 22.

Everything just fits! Now Black is better.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it is vague and does not specify which move was made incorrectly or why it is considered a mistake from Black's perspective.",1. e4 c5 2.

"White begins to go astray. Note that after 34.Be6 Bxc3! 35.bxc3 Qe5, Black consolidates for an easy win.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it describes the tactical consequences of losing a piece (the bishop) after 34.Be6, which allows Black to capture the bishop with Bxc3, leading to a material advantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. f5 Bxg5+ 14. Kb1 Ne5 15. Qh5 Qd8 16.
