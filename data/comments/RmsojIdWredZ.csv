"This is the Reti Opening, devised by the player of the White pieces in this game. In this hypermodern opening White allows his opponent to build up a pawn center and then attacks it from the flanks. 2.c4 is the opening salvo in this attack. Black can capture the c4-pawn but can't hold it after Qa4 or Na3.",True," The comment provides context about the Reti Opening, but it doesn't explain *why* the move is considered a mistake.",1.
