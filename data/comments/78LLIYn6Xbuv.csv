C42: Petroff Defence: 3 Nxe5 and unusual White 3rd moves,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the Petroff Defence opening and notes the unusual third moves (Nxe5) made by White, which likely indicates a mistake as they deviate from the traditional Petroff Defence strategy.",1. e4,"This is a game between Morozevich, A. (as White) and Polgar, Ju (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," The noted move Nxe5 in the Petroff Defence can be considered a mistake. This player chose to capture the pawn on e4, which could potentially open up their position to counterattacks. In general, the third move in this opening for White typically involves developing a knight to f3, aiming for a solid and flexible setup, rather than engaging in direct material exchange early on."
