"Anand has played the French Defense a few times, though it doesn't really seem ideal for his style. His 3rd round game with Kasparov was a Sicilian, but one where he was hunkered down and counter-attacking. Perhaps that's just his mood for this game too. The French Defense is one of the ideal defenses for that attitude (Alekhine's Def. and the Pirc/Modern/Gurgenidze Def. being others) .",True," The comment offers potential insights into why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting the player’s style might be hindering the defense.",1. e4 e6,"This is a game between Adams, Michael (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black).
