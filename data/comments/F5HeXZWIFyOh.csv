"Diverging from game one, when the more common 5...Nbd7 was played. This sideline of the Slav with 5...a6 was criticized by Kasparov after the game. From the continuation here we can see why. X3D Fritz is playing from its opening book right into a position it doesn't understand at all! When Kasparov said this everyone looked over at poor Alex Kure, the man responsible for selecting and ""training"" X3D Fritz's openings. Kasparov has little practical experience with this sideline and in both cases (once with white and once with black) the game continued with 6.b3. When this move appeared on the screen I thought maybe the Fritz team were trying to give Kasparov a little psychological jab. He played this move himself a month ago against Huzman in a game that turned into the shortest loss of his career after a horrific blunder. They wouldn't admit it, but you know they knew about that game and that Kasparov would be forced to think about while he was sitting there against X3D Fritz.",True," The comment provides insightful context regarding the player's tactical error and the potential psychological impact of the move, suggesting a deliberate attempt to undermine the opponent.",1.

"All of these moves had been played before, although Kasparov said afterwards that he was not conscious of that at the time at this point.

"Immediately sealing the queenside and diverging from that game from 1948, although there are still many similarities.

"An odd little prophylactic move that shows that Kasparov is betting that X3D Fritz won't know what to do in this position without any clear targets for its pieces. All the time Kasparov spent training with X3D Fritz clearly paid off. 13.h3 doesn't develop anything but it takes away a square from Black's knight, the g4 square.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting the move hinders development and creates a tactical weakness.",1.

Kasparov closes in on the isolated a5 pawn. After he captures it the white pieces will be a little tied up and during that time Black needs to counterattack vigorously on the kingside. Instead from now on we watch Kasparov consolidate on the queenside while X3D Fritz does absolutely nothing on the kingside. It has no clue that its only hope is to play its kingside pawns forward to break through the white pawn chain at its base.,True," The comment offers a potential explanation of why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting a lack of strategic response and a focus on a passive defensive strategy.",1.

"This got a good laugh from the Grandmaster commentators and the audience. Only a computer! It puts its bishop right where the white pawn can capture it. If Kasparov takes the bishop he loses his queen after 15.cxd6?? Nxb6 and the white queen is trapped. Of course Kasparov isn't going to blunder his queen away, so did this curious move have any other value? Maybe so, if Black thinks its bishop is more useful on the b8-h2 diagonal, attacking the kingside.",True," The comment highlights a potential tactical blunder and suggests a strategic consideration, indicating the move's value beyond just a simple capture.",1.

"Oh boy, now you know we're in the land of computer chess. As one of America's top players, GM Gregory Kaidanov, put it after the game, ""this move showed that the computer doesn't feel any embarrassment!""

Kasparov will slowly unravel his pieces on the queenside and prepare to push his a2 pawn up the board where it will break through and give him a protected passed b-pawn with an easily winning position.

"This useless-looking move confused most of the commentators, but to anyone with extensive anti-computer chess experience it makes perfect sense. The rook protects the f2 pawn, a potential weak spot, but why would you protect something that isn't being attacked? The reason goes into how computers think. It's brute force calculation can only go so deep, even with four super-fast processors. Black's only possible source of counterplay in this position is to push its f-pawn and open up an attack against area around the white king, f2 in particular. If X3D Fritz's search, usually running 12-20 half-moves deep, ever reaches a position in which it sees success in such an attack it will put such a plan in motion. On the other hand, if it cannot reach a favorable position in its searches it will never play the initial moves required. With the rook on b2 protecting f2 already, the potential weakness of that critical square is somewhat hidden from the computer's search. X3D Fritz can't just play it anyway like a human would, knowing that everything else is useless. A machine has to receive a positive evaluation from its search to play a move and always plays the move that gives it the best evaluation. Since X3D Fritz sees no danger here for itself it is content to play moves that do nothing, but don't cause any negative effect either. It twiddles its virtual reality thumbs. Any human would say, ""I have to do SOMETHING.""",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting the computer's analysis is overly cautious and doesn't account for human intuition.",1.
