"This game was published only in 1900, in the chess column of the newspaper ""Niva"", with a curious introduction by Chigorin. He wrote: ""Sometimes may happen that a chess game is repeated from the first move to the last one. It is possible when an unexperienced player in the opening play some natural- and good-looking move. Indeed such moves drive him to a defeat. One of such games will be now shown to you. The following opening is very common in amateur practice, and my opponent, an enthusiastic amateur has played it four times against me."" Chigorin does not tell us if there was a fifth time where his opponent, convinced by the previous four kicks, found the right continuation. I think this player should be remembered as ""Knorr the tenacious"".",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it provides historical context and describes the opponent's playing style, but does not directly address the specific move that was made.",1. e4,"This is a game between Knorr, V. (as White) and Chigorin, Mikhail (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4",-
A mistake. Even losing a tempo by retreating the Bishop in e3 was more convenient. (Chigorin),True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake, as retreating the Bishop in e3 was indeed less optimal compared to other possible moves.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4,"This is a game between Knorr, V. (as White) and Chigorin, Mikhail (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to h4", Chigorin made an error by retreating their Bishop to e3. It would have been better to lose a tempo by moving the Bishop to h4.
Exclamation mark!,True,"

The comment seems to be an indicator of a blunder, as an exclamation mark is often used to denote a significant mistake in chess comments.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5,"This is a game between Knorr, V. (as White) and Chigorin, Mikhail (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"," ""Black's last move to g5 was a risky play, potentially weakening their pawn structure."""
"Double excl amation mark!! Chigorin follows the same moves as the famous game Dubois-Steinitz played in London in 1862, so proving his interest in chess literature at that time.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it talks about Chigorin's interest in chess literature and a famous game, but does not address the specific move or its quality.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 h5,"This is a game between Knorr, V. (as White) and Chigorin, Mikhail (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5",-
"With this move instead, his opponent proves himself naif and little prepared. In fact now the next moves seem to be forced for White. Perhaps it was better to defend himself with",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by pointing out the inadequacy of the opponent's move, which allowed the opponent to gain a stronger position, making White's subsequent moves more constrained.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 h5 9. Nxg5,"This is a game between Knorr, V. (as White) and Chigorin, Mikhail (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on g5"," With this move, Chigorin shows a lack of foresight and preparation. White could now be forced into specific responses. It might have been wiser for White to defend."
(!),False,"

The comment ""(!)"" does not provide any explanation for the mistake made by the player; it's simply an exclamation mark indicating something unexpected or incorrect without further context.",1. e4 e5 2.

White resigns. Mate in five is inevitable.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the current position allows for a checkmate in five moves, leading to the resignation of White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 h5 9. Nxg5 h4 10. Nxf7 hxg3 11. Nxd8 Bg4 12. Qd2 Nd4 13. Nc3 Nf3+ 14. gxf3 Bxf3,"This is a game between Knorr, V.
