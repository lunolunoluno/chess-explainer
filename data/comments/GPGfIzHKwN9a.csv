Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4," White's move, Pawn to c4, was not a good choice. It's not the Queen's Gambit because White doesn't actually offer the pawn to gain an advantage. If Black captures the pawn with their d-pawn, White can simply recapture it."
Declining the gambit and defending the center.,True,"

Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3,This is a game between Schlecter (as White) and Przepiorka (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3,-

If now 7... exd5 then 8. Bb5 Bb7 9. Ne5 (Threatening 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. Bxd7+) 0-0 10. Bc6 Bxc6 11.Nxc6 and White has a strong postion.,True,"

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5," After 7... exd5, White should continue with 8. Bb5, aiming for a better position. However, after the move 9. Ne5, White is setting up a dangerous threat with 10. Bxf6. If Black plays 10... Bxf6, White has the tactical opportunity to follow up with 11. Bxd7+, winning a piece and gaining a strong advantage. Therefore, the move 9. Ne5 is not just bad but also leaves White's position precarious."
If 8... Bxg5 then 9. Nxc7+ Qxc7 10.Nxg5 and White is a pawn ahead.,True,"

Bxg5 is a mistake because after White plays 9. Nxc7+, Black can only move their Queen to c7 with Qxc7. Then, White's 10. Nxg5 will leave Black with an isolated queen, which significantly weakens their position."
White now has the more active pieces and a chance to bring the rook into action on the c file.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it appears to praise the active position of the white pieces, not addressing the previous move's shortcomings.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.
