Not the standard move here. Most common is 6... e5 fighting for the center. Black could also play 6... c5.

"A typical move in this position. White prepares to castle long and Pawn storm the black King. However, 7. Nh3-f2 is a better idea. Seirawan-Istratescu, 1994 continued 7.

A mistake. The move is logically designed to prevent black's Knights from going to g4 after white plays the natural f4 to drive away black's Knight on e5. Few better moves spring to mind for white here. 9. Bd3 Nxd3 uncoordinates the white position. 9. Ne2? Nxc4 loses material. Watch how black immediately targets the weakened g3 square.,True," The comment identifies a specific tactical blunder and suggests a counter-move, indicating a flawed strategic assessment.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

This move invites the Pawn fork which sacrifices black material for no clear tactical advantage. After the natural 11... gxf5 12. f4 Ng6 13. g3 would make black's Knights harmless. White is nearly forced to fork the black pieces in order to develop his own pieces.,True, The comment accurately identifies a potential tactical blunder and explains why it's a mistake.,1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"The point of this entire line of sacrifice is made with this move. The white King is stuck in the center. Castling Queenside would run into Bh6 immediately. White finds it difficult to develop his kingside pieces. Black has the initiative with the f-file battery. Therefore, white will find it hard to devise a defensive plan.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, though it's somewhat speculative.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

White can only curse his fortune. White cannot remove black's Rook on f3 because 16. Nxf3 Nxf3+ 17. Kd1 Bf5 18. Bg3 (not 18. Bd3 Nd4! 19. Bxd4 Qf3+ 20. Qe2 Qxh1+ 21. Kc2 Qxa1 wins material) 18... Qe3! 19. Bf2 Qxe4 20. Qxe4 Bxe4 21. Bg2 Rf8 gives black a superior end game.

"Black could also play for a winning endgame with 23...Qxf2 24. Nxf2 Ne3+ 25. Ke2 Nxg2, but GM Nunn plans for a beautifully coordinated attack.
