E81: King's Indian: Saemisch: 6th move deviations (including 6 Be3 c6),True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the mistake made by the player, specifically mentioning the deviation from the King's Indian Defense 6th move by playing 6. Be3.",1. d4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
Not the standard move here. Most common is 6... e5 fighting for the center. Black could also play 6... c5. The move played allows white to develop his g1 Knight safely to f2 via h3.,True,"

This comment explains the mistake made by the player as it describes an alternative, more common move and justifies the current move's purpose, which allows the development of the knight.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7"
"A typical move in this position. White prepares to castle long and Pawn storm the black King. However, 7. Nh3-f2 is a better idea. Seirawan-Istratescu, 1994 continued 7. Nh3 e5 8. d5 Nh5?! 9. g4 Nf4 10. Nxf4 exf4 11. Bxf4 Ne5 12. Be2 f5 13. exf5 gxf5 14. O-O fxg4 15. fxg4 h5!? 16. Bxe5 Bxe5 17. Qd3! gave white a clear advantage according to Seirawan in his book, Winning Chess Brilliancies. However, GM Nunn had prepared a special treatment of this line.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting an alternative and better move, referencing Seirawan-Istratescu's game from 1994, which demonstrates that Nh3-f2 could have been a superior choice for White, leading to a more favorable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
A mistake. The move is logically designed to prevent black's Knights from going to g4 after white plays the natural f4 to drive away black's Knight on e5. Few better moves spring to mind for white here. 9. Bd3 Nxd3 uncoordinates the white position. 9. Ne2? Nxc4 loses material. Watch how black immediately targets the weakened g3 square.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by explaining the consequences of the move, indicating an alternative play, and highlighting the strategic weakness exploited by black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"
This move invites the Pawn fork which sacrifices black material for no clear tactical advantage. After the natural 11... gxf5 12. f4 Ng6 13. g3 would make black's Knights harmless. White is nearly forced to fork the black pieces in order to develop his own pieces.,True,"
The comment accurately identifies a significant tactical error in the move, highlighting the potential fork and material loss without a clear benefit.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3 Nh5 10. Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on f5"
"The point of this entire line of sacrifice is made with this move. The white King is stuck in the center. Castling Queenside would run into Bh6 immediately. White finds it difficult to develop his kingside pieces. Black has the initiative with the f-file battery. Therefore, white will find it hard to devise a defensive plan.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the weaknesses in white's position, such as the central King's vulnerability, the difficulties in kingside development, and the control of the f-file by black, thus explaining the potential mistake made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3 Nh5 10. Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5 12. g4 Rxf3 13. gxh5 Qf8,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to f8"
White can only curse his fortune. White cannot remove black's Rook on f3 because 16. Nxf3 Nxf3+ 17. Kd1 Bf5 18. Bg3 (not 18. Bd3 Nd4! 19. Bxd4 Qf3+ 20. Qe2 Qxh1+ 21. Kc2 Qxa1 wins material) 18... Qe3! 19. Bf2 Qxe4 20. Qxe4 Bxe4 21. Bg2 Rf8 gives black a superior end game. The black Queen assumes a dominating position in the middle of the board planning Bc8-f5 and Ra8-f8.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the inability to remove Black's Rook on f3, leading to a superior endgame for Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3 Nh5 10. Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5 12. g4 Rxf3 13. gxh5 Qf8 14. Ne4 Bh6 15. Qc2 Qf4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to f4"
"Black could also play for a winning endgame with 23...Qxf2 24. Nxf2 Ne3+ 25. Ke2 Nxg2, but GM Nunn plans for a beautifully coordinated attack. The end is near.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the quality or mistake of the player's previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 Ne5 9. h3 Nh5 10. Bf2 f5 11. exf5 Rxf5 12. g4 Rxf3 13. gxh5 Qf8 14. Ne4 Bh6 15. Qc2 Qf4 16. Ne2 Rxf2 17. Nxf2 Nf3+ 18. Kd1 Qh4 19. Nd3 Bf5 20. Nec1 Nd2 21. hxg6 hxg6 22. Bg2 Nxc4 23.
