"No surprise here.

Sofi's pet variation against the French from the white side. She never opted (at least not that I remember) for 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 etc. with slower spatial play.

"This idea Viktor uses is not new by any means. 7...a6!? has the idea of pushing to b5 and bringing the bishop out on b7. It's a solid line, which doesn't waste time as it may seem with the wing pawn advance. Why is that exactly? I thought we were taught that all unneeded wing pawn advances are a waste of time? However, tempo has a less binding effect in the closed game. This position is very closed. The kings don't ""need"" to get to safety immediately, the development of pieces quickly is not quite as important as staking out space with pawns in this type of game. Therefore, 4...a6 is a useful strategic move that doesn't lose tempo to any serious extent.",True," The comment offers a counter-argument to the player's assessment, suggesting a more flexible approach to development.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

This capture is well timed. Because the e5 pawn is covered solidly by its counterpart at f4 it's ok that the d-pawn leave e5's defense. More importantly this profits white the nice d4 square to plop a knight when the time is right.

"This is still theory. This is obviously a needed move. The black queen at her current post is far too menacing. Also played before was 13. b4?! This possibly natural move is very, very bad. This weakens a whole row of squares on the c-file. The plan for black would hardly be difficult then. I like Sofi's choice a lot. The queen exchange would definitely benefit her. If 13. Ne2?! then simply 13... Qb6! (13...b4!? is possible too) and black's just fine once again. He'll simply continue with Rc8 and Nc5 with a wonderful position.
