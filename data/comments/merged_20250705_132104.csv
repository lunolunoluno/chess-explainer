The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it points out the tactical error of removing the defender on c3, which allowed Black to gain a pawn with Nxe4, and highlights the impending loss of a piece due to a pin on the e-line.",1. b4 e5 2. Nc3 Bxb4 3. Bb2 Nf6 4. e4 Nc6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. g3 Nd4,This is a game between W17 (as White) and B17 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d4," Black played a move that was not favorable.

"Why not win the pawn on h3? White can't trap the Bishop with 11. g4 since by taking the pawn, the bishop would also threaten the rook at f1. This concept is known as gaining a tempo.",TRUE,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it correctly identifies the potential advantage of capturing the pawn on h3 and the possibility of gaining a tempo by disrupting the black bishop's position.",1. b4 e5 2.

"?! Definitely dubious. This makes black's pawn structure slightly weaker. Why not solidfy central control with ...c6, Re8, with a ...d5 expansion? Remember, when ahead in material, trade pieces, not pawns.",TRUE,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by highlighting the weakening of the pawn structure and suggests a better move to solidify central control and prepare for a pawn expansion, which aligns with the principles of material advantage in chess.",1. b4 e5 2.

"As a result of this interchange, white has 3 pawn islands, black has 2. A pawn island is a group of pawns separated by open files. This should give black a slight endgame advantage.

Alternatively, 15...Nd5 offered Black a better position.

In Sion Castro-Karpov, Black's early 12...g5! was crucial. White's 14.g4 was a mistake, allowing Black to counter with 14...Bb7, leading to a strong position for Black. The game demonstrated that Black's proactive approach with 12...g5 was the better choice."
"Up until now, the queen almost automatically retreated to e2, for example, Sokolov played this against me once (Belfort 1988).

Black can try to improve by playing 15...c5, which is better than 15...Nf6, but White can still maintain a lead with 16.g4 followed by 17.g5, putting further pressure on Black's position.

The move 11.Qh4 was a bad choice as it led to a difficult situation for White. After 11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 Qh5, White is put in a precarious position.

"This quite paradoxical king move to the center of the board was found by me back in 1988, while I was preparing for the aforementioned game against Kasparov. I was afraid of the queen shift to the kingside. The exchange of queens seemed to me to be a dull idea. It took me a long time before I found the correct decision. And so this important novelty remained a secret for five years! The idea of the king move is that black unexpectedly harmonizes the placement of his pieces, which were a bit out of sync only a move ago. But now the threat is g7-g5-g4, winning a piece.

"The Sicilian Defense Wing Gambit Deferred is a rare line in the Sicilian because both sides would end up with a slightly poor position in their different respects with long-term advantages siding with Black. The natural 3. d4 is a much better response for white increasing his advantage in central space while not making any positional or tactical compromises. Now Black has two options. 1. He should try to retain the extra pawn, which is not a difficult task to do in this variation making it a slightly incorrect gambit (not as bad as the Morra though) or 2. He should attempt to gain development and initiative with Nf6 (the stronger line - for details, look at annotation about move 4. Nf6).",TRUE,"

The comment does explain the mistake as it provides a detailed analysis of the move and suggests alternative options that would have been more beneficial for the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. b4 cxb4,This is a game between W48 (as White) and B48 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on b4," The move played by Black resulted in a less advantageous position. The Sicilian Defense Wing Gambit Deferred is an uncommon choice, leading to a compromised stance for both players. The better strategy for White is to play 3. d4, which enhances their control over central territory without risking their position. Black now faces two choices: retain the pawn, which is manageable but not ideal, or develop with Nf6, seeking a more dynamic game. White's decision to play 3. d4 is preferable because it avoids the pitfalls of the Wing Gambit Deferred, where Black's position would be weaker and White would gain a significant edge over the long term."
"Immediately, White claims the black central squares as his with 4. d4. He intends maximum piece deployment and speedy development, while gaining space. Arguably, it's the best move on the board. 4...Nf6 a move earlier, declining the gambit, was probably a stronger opening line theoretically as opposed to the accepting of the gambit. Typically the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it as you did, but not if you can gain so much time, development and static advantages in pawn structure that you can create a won game before the opening ends. Observe: After 3. Nf6, a line might be 4. bxc5 Nxe4 5. cxd6 Nc6 6. Bd3 (required in order to keep black's advantage in time less felt and because the queen's bishop can come out actively on b2, not requiring the movement of the d-pawn) Nf6 7. Nc3 e5 8. d7+ Bxd7 9. 0-0 Bd6, and you have an advantage in time (2 tempi as black!) with open lines, attacking chances, and an advantage in pawn structure. A master would typically consider those advantages unrealistic with perfect play by white, but it's very achievable after 3...Nf6 in this opening variation which is a main reason this line hasn't been analyzed in depth over the years. But, since you accepted the gambit on move 3, 4. Nf6 was a logical and required move. I question your idea at move 5, not just the specific move you made. It's not a bad idea certainly. A fianchettoed bishop is needed in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian to coordinate a queenside attack, but in this precise position, due to all the open lines not usually there as well as a pawn you're now trying to hold on to, 5. e6 would seem more logical setting up a Scheveningen-type formation, the purpose being mainly to allow the queen's knight to come out without being harassed, which otherwise would occur by Bb5 and d5. Observe the resulting position after you play 5. e6 with the following line: 6. Bd3 Be7 7. 0-0 0-0 8. Qe2 Nc6 9. Bb2 (mainly threatening 10. d5 with the unleashing of a dangerous bishop harping on the king) d5 in which you're successfully defending your b4 pawn remaining a pawn ahead, while now possessing the c4 outpost on your half-open c-file. 6. Bb2 was the first positional blunder by white. White should've put the question to the limiting pawn by Rb1 and an eventual a3 because it's not easy to defend it after your faulty 5th move. Another reason it's important to eliminate that annoying b-pawn is to allow him to advance to c4 increasing his spatial plus. The text is a move without specific purpose. It's unclear yet where the queen's bishop should reside. Also, later in the game in order to activate that bishop, it requires giving up control of e5 with a pawn as well as loses time by not attacking with the advance.",TRUE,"

The comment provides an in-depth analysis of the move 4. Nf6, explaining why it's considered the best move, the consequences of accepting the gambit, and the suggested better alternatives. It clarifies the strategic objectives and potential pitfalls of the move, thus correctly identifying the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. b4 cxb4 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nbd2 g6 6. Bb2 Bg7,This is a game between W48 (as White) and B48 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g7," Playing 5. e6 in this position seems premature, aiming for a Scheveningen formation, while White's bishop on b2 could be more aggressively placed. This move allows Black to defend their b4 pawn with d5, and White misses the opportunity to challenge Black's pawn structure and gain a more active position. A better move would involve White's rook to b1 and a potential advance of a3 to target the b2 pawn, which would create more space for White and allow the bishop to become more active on the board."
"7. Bd3 is a typical developing move adding pressure on the center. It isn't the best one, however. In this position, e2 is a much better post for the bishop. The advantage at e2 is one of avoiding the cramp that d3 entails and the supporting eventual kingside expansion via h4-5 destroying black's fianchettoed position. 8. Qc1 was an extremely questionable move by your brother. It doesn't seem to have any active plan associated with it at all according to his next moves. I'm not sure whether he played it to unpin a possibly pinned knight at f3, to push the c-pawn (a good plan, but a bad first move to carry it out), or to clear d1 for a different piece. Whatever his initial thought was with that move, if he had any, he didn't follow up. Much better is a3 or castling immediately, which continue to undergo a plan. Observe the resulting position after this line: 8. a3 bxa3 9. Rxa3 Nc6 10. 0-0 Nb4 11. Be2. Things look about as decent as they can with white after his previous play. 8. Bd7 was your first major strategically related mistake. D7 is the worst square for the queen's bishop. This is a passive and hindering move as opposed to 8. Nd7 the ideal move for the situation. Even 8. Bg4 had its own merit. The reason 8. Nd7 would be preferred is because it allows for the excellent queenside play including the moves: a6, b5, Bb7, Qc7, Rc8, Nb6 following with Nc4 supported by the b-pawn and heavy pieces on the c-file. Another major plus of having the heavy pieces on the c-file is the pressuring of white's backward c-pawn. Bd7 hindered the plan the board wanted you to play. 9. d5 was a poor choice of move by white. First off, he wrongly developed his bishop to b2 earlier in the game making it a handicap that he's trying to get rid of now, secondly, he's wasting time trying to activate it, lastly he gave up control of the important e5 square with a pawn. Much better was the obvious 9. 0-0. It's good that you played by principle (opening up the position when your opponent hasn't castled), but it leads to a dead end since he can castle with one move at any time. Better was Na6 trying to get your rooks into play and protecting your pawn that you're trying to hold onto. Instead of moving a piece twice in the opening by 10. Bc4, white should've taken his ""reasonable"" opportunity to castle!",TRUE,"

The comment accurately identifies and explains the errors made by the player in their moves Bd7, d5, and Bc4, providing a clear understanding of the strategic weaknesses that these moves introduced.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. b4 cxb4 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nbd2 g6 6. Bb2 Bg7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc1 Bd7 9. d5 e6 10. Bc4 exd5,This is a game between W48 (as White) and B48 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d5," The move 7. Bd3 by white is not optimal, as e2 would have been a superior square for the bishop. This choice avoids the cramped d3 position and supports potential kingside expansion via h4-5, which could threaten black's fianchettoed bishop.

8. Qc1 by your brother was a questionable move with no clear strategy. It may aim to unpin a pinning knight or prepare to push the c-pawn, but its execution immediately afterward was poor. A3 or castling would have been more advisable, continuing the plan. After 8. a3 bxa3 9. Rxa3 Nc6 10. 0-0 Nb4 11. Be2, the position improved slightly for white.

8. Bd7 by white was a significant blunder. D7 is a passive square for the queen's bishop. The better move, Nd7, would allow for queenside play including a6, b5, Bb7, Qc7, Rc8, Nb6, backed by a b-pawn and active pieces on the c-file,"
"11. exd5 was a poor move. 10. Bc4 would've been a tiny bit more reasonable if he would've captured d5 with it. After 11. exd5 white's game starts to go downhill. 11. Re8+ is making powerful use of the e-file to white's demise. Still better than 12. b5 is 12. Na6 getting the rest of your forces into the battle. Again, instead of 13. Nxd5, 13. Na6 was once again indicated. The ""material advantage"" after what you played was only illusory and it also allowed white to swap black-squared bishops weakening your king.",TRUE,"

Bc4) would have been a better choice than trading it (11. exd5), as it would have kept more pieces on the board and maintained a stronger position for white.",1. e4 c5 2.

Bc4 would have been slightly better had it captured d5. After this, the game for White started to decline. 11. Re8+ effectively used the e-file against White, contributing to their disadvantage. A move like 12. b5 was better than 13. Nxd5, with 13. Na6 being preferable. The apparent material gain after White's last move was a false hope, allowing Black to exchange Black-squared bishops, which further weakened White's position."

"Much better than 19. Re1 was Qd4, because it attempts to trade heavy pieces and gain the initiative after white retakes with the knight because it compels black to do something about the hanging pawn.

Better than 22. h5 was Qa1 taking advantage of him not retreating the Queen to b1 on his 22nd move. 23. Qh3 was an incorrect retreat. You shouldn't back you queen into the edge. She needs to be centralized. 23. Qe2 was indicated, taking control of the open e-file and preventing black's rook from doing the same. In response, 23.

Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on a2," White's strategy was not optimal. Instead of recapturing with the knight after Qd4, White could have played a4 to weaken Black's pawn structure. Moving the queen to a1 took advantage of Black's missed opportunity to retreat on 22nd move (to b1). White's queen move to h3 was poor, as it left the queen at the edge with limited defensive options. Instead, a central queen move like Qe2 would control the open e-file and provide more support to the rook. The rook move Re8 should have been played to support central control and improve coordination with the queen."
"24. Qa3 was better than the text because it's generally a poor idea to trade pieces being down in material. 25. Re8 wasn't as forcing as the immediate Bc4+. You were probably setting up the trap that white fell into, but you should play the most forcing moves. 26. g4 was the game-losing blunder. White went two more pawns down and could never recover. In case anyone was wondering, the line to win the extra material would be: 26. Bc4+ 27. Kg2 hxg4 28. Nh2 Bd5+ 29. f3 gxf3+ 30. Nhxf3 Nd4 31. Kg3 Rxe1 32. Rxe1 Bxf3 and white loses two more pawns. You both played very decently against one another for not playing each other in 30 years.

"This move makes sense. Objectively it may be questionable but it offers Black two pluses. First it gives Black the half-open c - file. Second it breaks up the White center pawns. One reason for questioning this move is that it does not appear to be consistent with the objectives of Black's choice of opening. Always remember there is a plus in every negative on the chessboard. Chess is an exchange of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, if you drop a piece you generally get two moves in exchange for it. Sometimes the two moves are more critical than the piece. It is the reason that sacrifices work. That is why chess coaches warn younger players to not chase pawns. It is not worth the moves that are given up. In the games that I've seen, it appears that Black wants a quick resolution to the game by choosing this move.",FALSE,"

Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5," White plays Qg3, which could lead to a disadvantageous situation. By doing so, White forces Black's king to castle Kingside, leaving it weak. Moreover, without the dark square bishop, Black's position is compromised. Moving the knight to f3 could also become problematic for White if Black develops appropriately."
"This move is too ambitious at this point. Now Black will be stuck with an over-extended pawn. In the French, Black must defend first, THEN attack. Development was essential on move 9. Again a move that makes sense. 9/\d4 is not as bad as you think. The move is not an ""attack."" Pawn moves are seldom for purposes of ""attack."" As a general rule, the idea of the pawn move is to gain or control space. I do however agree that this move is ill timed and too ambitious. In a sense the pawn is sacrificed for open lines. The problem for Black is that these open lines benefit White! BTW, in every defense the idea is to ""defend first, THEN attack."" All attacks must have positional justification. Black does have a problem unraveling his development in the French Defense - your opponent compounds this natural problem. This is why I do not personal recommend the French Defense you young players. If you are interested in completely frustrating someone playing the French Defense try the ""Exchange Variation."" It takes all the fun out of it for Black.",TRUE,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by highlighting the problems with the pawn move, suggesting its timing and ambition were poor, and offering a better defensive approach in the French Defense.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d4," The recent move by Black to d4 is premature and could lead to overextension. In the French Defense, Black's priority should be on establishing a solid defense, then advancing with an attack. Moving the pawn on move 9 seems aggressive, but pawn advances are usually about gaining control rather than attacking. While it opens lines that could be advantageous for White, this move doesn't align with strategic positioning. Black's development in the French Defense is already challenging, and this move exacerbates the issue. It's critical to always aim for a well-founded attack. If your goal is to disrupt Black's comfort in the French, consider using the ""Exchange Variation."""
"Black's develop ment is now becoming less effective because his pieces are being pinned and becoming useless. Black is cramped but at this point is fine. Do not mistake a cramped position for a bad position. Some defenses are specifically designed to make maxim use of as little space as possible. These can be very tough to crack and if the attacker relaxes or mishandles the position, it could get real ugly real fast. One characteristic of a cramped position is the interlocking of pieces. This is called ""over protection."" The idea is that for every attacker on a piece there is at least one more defender. This makes the various pieces more flexible - you can move any defender and not give up material. About pins: You place a high value on them for good reason. Pins often decide the game! There are two types of pins. There is the ""absolute"" pin. These are pins where the first piece can not move because the King is behind it. Then there is the ""relative"" pin where the defender can choose to give up material. The difference is that the second is flexible while the first is not. The ""magic"" behind the pin is the inflexibility of the pinned piece and generally its' defender. With one piece you can tie up as many as three defenders! That's like playing a virtual piece or two ahead. Another thing to like about pins is that they can quickly become a permanent positional advantage. Once you get a pin, work on the front piece - start piling up the attack on it.",TRUE,"

Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5," In this situation, White is executing a strategic maneuver by moving their bishop to g5. Black's development has been less effective as their pieces now face pins, rendering them less effective. While Black might seem to be in a cramped position, it does not necessarily mean it's a poor position. Certain defenses thrive in such tight spaces, making them difficult to penetrate. A characteristic of such conditions is ""over protection"" where the interlocking of pieces, due to pins, makes the pieces more versatile; moving one defender doesn't compromise material strength. Pins are highly valued in chess as they can dictate the game's flow. Understanding the difference between absolute and relative pins is key, with absolute pins being non-negotiable and relative pins offering some flexibility. Once a pin is established, focusing on the pinned piece can turn it into a dominant advantage."
"Missing /\Qa5+ and /\Nxe5. The stronger of the two would be /\Nxe5, completely dissolving the White center and freeing Black's game.

It's a critical moment to avoid sacrificing key pieces like pawns unless there's a clear, powerful reason, such as an inevitable checkmate. When unsure, focus on enhancing the least effective pieces in your position. Grandmasters often employ this strategy when the correct move isn't immediately apparent. Concentrating your more powerful pieces, such as rooks and the queen, on open files is a strategic advantage. Pay attention to your opponent's moves to understand their intentions. If you consider why your opponent chose to make that move, it can reveal their strategy to attack your pieces or set up a checkmate, allowing you to counteract effectively."

"White shows his aggressive designs from the very beginning. Akesson had never used this lunge, so to some extent it became a surprise for me, but, frankly speaking, rather pleasant one. Let me a little digression to explain to my readers what these feelings are bound up with. I studied chess at the Leningrad Pioneers' Palace (subscribers of the ""New in Chess"" Magazine could feel its atmosphere with the help of the remarkable essay of Genna Sosonko, dedicated to Vladimir Zak [""A great teacher inspires"" - see NIC 99/5]). A very experienced master Sergey Khavsky was my coach (by the way, a well-known St.Petersburg grandmaster Vladimir Epishin, living now in Germany, was one of his students). Well, master Khavsky inculcated us steadfast disgust for moves like g2-g4 and g7-g5, especially when one makes them at the open position or having a king unprovided for. He often said that ""the only case to play g2-g4 is when you win at least a piece"". We even invented a special term for such a move - ""the anti-Khavsky move"". Accordingly, when an opponent resorts to the move, I feel an insuperable desire to ""punish"" him for this untimely activity and permanently tell myself that ""a pawn doesn't advance back"" and that ""the position weakening must adversaly affect early or late"".",TRUE,"

The comment indicates that the move g2-g4 was against the player's coaching principles and was considered a fundamental mistake, showing a misunderstanding of the player's chess philosophy and strategy.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. g4,"This is a game between Akesson, Ralf (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g4"," White's move g4, although unexpected, evokes a sense of displeasure. This move, often derided by a coach who instilled a deep-seated aversion to such openings, is seen as a weak play, especially unguarded. The strategy of advancing a pawn to g4 typically occurs when a player expects to gain material advantage, but in this instance, the move feels premature. It feels like White is forcing a confrontation on a defensive front that isn't prepared for such an aggressive stance. The strategy is akin to a ""punishment"" for pushing the pawn without securing a position, and it underlines the importance of maintaining a solid defense before advancing one's pawns."
"Had a pawn stayed on g2 instead of g5, the advantage of White would have been incontestable, for he has two bishops and a solid center. But now the weakening of the White's kingside gives Black objects for counterplay. That moment I thought kindly of master Khavsky once more.",TRUE,"

I myself did the same when I was a youth, and by continually going over games that I lost/drew, I found out what I did wrong, and resolved not to repeat them. I did go over wins as well to look for improvements, but rarely did I learn as much. BTW, I have a feeling that if the computer gives you a free queen again, it will be in trouble, because you've learned from your mistakes! Keep up the good fight.",TRUE,"

It's great to see you engaging with our community, even in instances where you face defeat. Analyzing your game, specifically the move where White played King to d3, shows a strategic misstep. Often, studying your losses or draws can be incredibly enlightening, offering valuable insights into your gameplay. It's through such analysis that players grow and refine their chess skills. As someone who has been down this road, I've learned that repetition of mistakes is a common pitfall. This particular move by White may have offered Black an unexpected advantage, which is a valuable lesson in anticipating your opponent's strategy. If the computer were to make a similar error by giving up a queen, it would likely struggle to recover. Keep challenging yourself, and continue to learn from these experiences. Your dedication is commendable."

"By playing 4...Nf6, Wollner avoids some of the terrifying tactics of the Danish proper. At the time, this was considered a fully viable mode of defense. Wollner, perhaps understandably, was reluctant to grab that final pawn. Today, theory claims that Black can wend his way to equality by giving back the material in a tactical counter-trick, as follows: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5 The first pawn is given back. 6.Bxd5 Nf6 7.Bxf7+ And now, the second.

That may be true, but it's worth pointing out that the position is also very sharp, with substantial pawn majorities for each side. Some correspondence players have recently resurrected this variation as a winning attempt for White. It demands accurate defensive play from Black, because White's pawns advancing on the Kingside ""bite"" faster, thanks to Black's exposed Knight and King. In this side line, there's one other move also worth considering. When Black plays ... Nf6, White need not liquidate but can instead play for central domination by accenting his development: 7.Nc3 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 One of the many interesting points in this line is that Black cannot force an exchange of Queens here, thanks to a very clever tactical shot: 8...c6 ... apparently forcing the Knight to move, but -- 9.Nf6+ White pulls Black's pieces forcibly into a fork! 9...gxf6 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxf6+ ... and when the dust clears, White is the exchange ahead.

"Solid, but/ \. As a defender you must be aggressive. You also have the option to transpose into more familiar territory with 3/\.dxe4 4. Nxe4 5. Bf5. Also a tempting idea between moves 3 through 9 is the move /\d4. This is an attempt to close the center and gain space on the Queenside. Again this is a matter of personality. My favorite way of attacking the Two Knights Variation is to play 5/\Nf6 if 6. e5 then the center will be permanently locked giving you the chance to make your Knights better than the opponent's Bishops. You can choose between Nfd7 and Ne4. If White tries 6.d5 then 6/\dxe4. The idea is that Black gains a move (tempo) 7.Qe3 e6 (The d4 pawn is undefended if 7.Nxe4 Qxd4.). Now after the exchange on e4 the Queen Knight heads for d5 through d7 and f6. The idea is to plant the Knight securely on d5, making it, in theory better than the White Bishop pair.",TRUE,"

Nc3 e6,This is a game between W34 (as White) and B34 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6," 'White's move was solid, but Black must be aggressive to maintain balance. Interestingly, there's an opportunity for White to transition into more grounded positions with 1.dxe4, followed by 2.Nxe4 and 3.Bf5. Additionally, White might consider playing 1.d4, aiming to seal the center and expand on the Queenside. This choice is often a reflection of personal style. In attacking the Two Knights Variation, if 6.e5 locks the center, White can leverage their Knights over Black's Bishops, opting for 5.Nf6. If White plays 6.d5, Black can respond with 6.dxe4, gaining a tempo with 7.Qe3 e6. The exchange on e4 positions the White Knight to advance to d5, d7, and f6, aiming to secure a strong Knight position, potentially superior to White's Bishop duo.'"
"Here is the chance to create some interesting possibilities. For instance 6/\.d4 7. Ne2 Qb6. White is forced to commit to some sort of stand on the Queenside. One idea would be to play 8. c3.

White might consider advancing with 6. d4, followed by Ne2. However, this plan is flawed for several reasons. Firstly, it commits White to the Queenside without proper development, creating weaknesses. An alternative strategy with 8. c3 strengthens White's position, but Black's pieces are still not optimally placed, setting the stage for a challenging struggle ahead."
"While not objectiv ely unsound, 7/\.c5 invites many problems. Here the problem again is the lack of development.

Nbd7 8. O-O-O Bd6. Now Black can try to ""clear and seal"" with /\c5 and /\d4. The concept involves clearing the Knight from it's defensive post and using the pawn structure to seal off the opponents pieces on the opposite side of the board.

"16. Bc3? Afte r building a strong initiative, with a little help from your passive game, White plays a poor move. 16. Nxd4 cxd4 17. e5 Bc7 looks more interesting for White. With the d - file open and the Knight planted on d4 Black can easily equalize with 16/\e5. If 17. Bxd4 cxd5 gains a strong initiative for Black. Even 17. Nxd4 exd4 neuters the Bishop and gets you back into the game. With this exchange Black accomplishes several of White's major goals. (As much as possible, do not help your opponent. Never force your opponent to do something that you will regret!) First, Black opens the d - file White's only means of attack. Second Black opens the long diagonal (a1- h8) for White, in effect giving White the center. Finally, Black opens (abandons) the center. Once you post a Knight in your opponent's territory keep it there or make the opponent sacrifice (or pay a high price) to get rid of it. The reward for this is that White will seize the d - file and disrupt Black's ""key ranks"" (the 1,2,7,8 ranks) with the Bishops.",TRUE,"

Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e2," After B34's move, B34, playing black, took the pawn on e2. White's 16. Bc3 is a weak move, as it does not contribute to their strategy and even harms their position. It's better for White to play 16. Nxd4 cxd4, which opens the d-file for White's rook and gives Black a good counterplay with moves like 17. e5. Instead, 17. Bxd4 cxd5 allows Black to equalize effectively. If White plays 17. Nxd4 exd4, they sacrifice a knight without gaining anything. Black's move accomplishes several objectives:

1. It opens the d-file, which is White's main attacking resource.
2. It opens the long diagonal, seizing the center.
3. It allows Black to abandon the center, which can be a strategic decision.

"Giving up the Bishop is a new concession that in effect looses the game. The Bishop was the only piece that was keeping the Black Rooks from invading your territory.

Black allowed White to capture the d - file. This was complicated by giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding d6. Your weak points seem to be the lack of control of the central squares, lack of understanding pawn play, and (I suspect) the inability to understand the board position. Now for the good: somehow you managed to maintain your balance in a difficult position. You came up with a creative attacking idea (29/\.c4) when you needed it. With a solid understanding of the position and your creativity you will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus your game on the center. I'd suggest that you attack the center with simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the center) games. You may want to consider charting the pawn structures in your games. For instance, you may do better in positions without center pawns. I would suggest that you explore more aggressive openings - especially gambits. While you are charting your games give careful attention to when you make your errors. For instance in this game you could mark moves 16 and 24 as major errors. When you come up to your common problem moves, give yourself extra time to think through your move and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will bring fast improvement. Qa8+ resign",TRUE,"

This piece was crucial in preventing the black rooks from advancing and threatening your territory. Normally, players might consider exchanging off attacking pieces, but in this case, that approach doesn't apply. The situation demands a specific response, not a generic tactic. After black plays 31...Rc8, it's clear that black's attempt to aid the bishop doesn't change the situation. White's move 32.Rc4 Qa5 followed by 33.Rxc8+ Kxc8 34.Qa7 35.Qc7 puts black at a disadvantage. Black's loss of control over the center and the weakening of their position, especially after the loss of the knight on d4 and the bishop on d6, are significant.

"I understand your wish to post a knight on c5, but this move is dubious. By far, the e5 square is a better outpost. It is a hole in your opponent's position. A hole is a square that your opponent's pawns can't cover. c5, on the other hand, can easily be covered by the black b-pawn.

"A good rule of thumb to follow is: don't attack until you've gotten all your knights & bishops out, and you've castled to safety! Your entire army wants to get involved in the fight.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5," White's last move of playing Pawn to d5 is risky. It's generally not wise to launch a full-scale attack before ensuring all knights and bishops are out and your king is safely castled. Engaging only a few pieces can make White vulnerable to being outmaneuvered by Black's entire arsenal, akin to a 3-on-1 scenario in basketball. The move Be2 is preferable to avoid a potential discovered check, should Black opt for...e5. Post this, Black's play of 8.... Qxc5 followed by 9. dxc6 Qxc6 could result in White losing a pawn."
"This isn't good. Black is threatening ...Qxc5. White MUST prevent the loss of a piece. Qe2! does the job!

"The Giuoco Pianissimo. The idea is to play a quiet controlled game. Unfortunately many underestimate the potential of quiet moves and quiet games. This is fine if you understand the options and what you are choosing. For instance 4.0-0 is strongest and 4.d4 is interesting. Also playable is 4.Nc3 but this leads down some very sharp lines. I don't like this move. It certainly develops a piece but it does not stop the intended 5. d4. This gives White a target in the center, which means that time can be gained by attacking the Bishop. d4 An interesting idea is 5.b4 but it is generally wise to play in the center unless there is a specific reason. cxd4 Bb6 Again, Black does not help the cause in the center. /\Bb4+ is much stronger and because it puts pressure on the White center (attacking a supporting pieces with a pin). Also notice that the Bishop has moved twice and is not necessarily useful at b6 in this position. b3 Fasinating idea. The possibilities of playing Bb2 or Ba3 offer Black some potential headaches. I personally like 7.0-0 because another primary idea of the opening is King safety. Preparing to castle is one of those keys.

The main idea was to keep the game quiet and controlled, but by choosing a move that doesn't target the center, white missed an opportunity. Moving the pawn to c3 did not directly contribute to securing central control, which is generally a priority in this opening.

In terms of the specific moves mentioned:

- 4.0-0 is strong as it allows white to castle and secure their king.
- 4.d4 targets the center and can potentially gain an advantage.
- 4.Nc3 doesn't necessarily stop the intended move 5.d4, and the piece development doesn't contribute significantly to central control.
- 5.b4 is a less common move that could be interesting, but in this position, it's not essential to play in the center unless there's a clear reason.
- After 5.d4 cxd4, Black's move to b6 doesn't help in controlling the center.
- The move +Bb4+ could be stronger because it puts pressure on White's central structure and the Bishop on b6 might not be useful at that point."
"Lilienthal opens in classical fashion, and Capablanca shows his flexibility by adopting the NimzoIndian Defense -- a fashionable new continuation at the time that shocked some of the classically-minded theoreticians. The NimzoIndian is a formidably complex opening with many fascinating byways, but the ideas at the outset are not too difficult to understand. White, by playing 3.Nc3, threatens to play 4.e4. Even the ""hypermodernists"" realized that giving White this much leeway in the center was a recipe for trouble, so Black must find a way to deter White from occupying that square. The standard method, before Nimzowitsch began to spread his heresy, was 3...d5, transposing into a Queen's Gambit Declined. This effectively stops 4.e4 by putting additional guards on that key square. The Nimzoindian, by contrast, stops e4 by depriving the pawn of support -- the pinned N/c3 is no longer rendering active service. White has a wide range of responses. 4.Qc2, one of the earliest moves to gain favor, has recently come back into vogue. During the 1970's, it was difficult to find any master who would play anything but 4.e3. Romanishin experimented with 4.g3 in the 1980's.

"What is the point of this stunning Queen sacrifice? How can White get away with it? The answer lies, as it usually does for any really difficult combination, in multiple factors: the opening of the e-file, the presence of the B/h4, and the arrival of a pawn at g7 which will simultaneously strike at h8 and take away a flight square at f8. Black has little choice now but to accept the Queen sacrifice. Trying to take the B/h4 instead fails, because of the most common of all tactical motifs, an undefended piece -- in this case, the R/c8. Thus: if 20...Qxh4 21.fxg7 Rg8 22.f6! and now 22...Nxf6 fails to 23.Qf5! forking f6 and c8 while pinning the hapless N/f6 against the f7 pawn.",TRUE,"

20...Qxh4

Planning to exchange White's remainnig center pawn. Perhaps it would have been more prudent to make a developing move.,TRUE,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the player's choice to exchange the center pawn instead of opting for a developing move, which could potentially improve the position on the chessboard.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on c5," The White bishop's positioning blocks the potential queen exchange, making the last move less advantageous."
Recapturing and developing the bishop at the same time.,TRUE,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of recapturing the bishop instead of developing a piece, which is a common strategic error in beginner play.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Ng3 e6 6. Nf3 c5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. dxc5 Bxc5,This is a game between Spielmann (as White) and Hunlinger (as Black).

Protecting f7 with the queen.,TRUE,"

The comment likely explains the mistake because placing the queen on f7 unnecessarily exposes it to threats, such as the common checkmate pattern known as the ""f7 square,"" which occurs when the queen is targeted due to its vulnerable position.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

The position on the board is advantageous for White, who should focus on developing their pieces and creating threats. It's important for White to consider moves that leverage their Bishop pair's dominance on the Kingside, as well as their control over the dark squares due to Black's lack of coordination.

In the recent move, Be3, White missed an opportunity to capitalize on the position. Instead of Be3, White should have considered developing the Knight with Nbd2 or Bc5. This would have been a more forceful move, putting pressure on Black's position and potentially creating tactical opportunities. Moving Qg3 also misses the mark, as it fails to utilize White's Bishop pair effectively. Instead, White should aim for moves like Bxh6, which could exploit Black's uncoordinated pieces and weaken their position.

White's dominance on the Kingside is largely due to their Bishop pair and control of the dark squares, which Black lacks. To take advantage of these factors, White should focus on moves that disrupt Black's coordination and create"

Rg1 Rf8 b4 Rg8 Interesting. 31/\ h4 prolongs the agony. gxh6 gxh6 Suggestions #1: Work on your positional understanding. A big area to focus on would be superior minor pieces. In this game you never made use of your Bishops - they tended to be glorified pawns. They are key in the Colle - K. If you don/^t use them, you need another opening! Suggestion #2: Consider a more flexible opening such as the Torre or Colle - Zukertort. (+)Forcing[+] openings tend to be (+)one idea[+] openings. One of the dangers of (+) forcing[+] openings is the guys that write the books make us think that all we have to do is understand the ideas behind the openings. Unfortunately the idea may be completely misguided in a given concrete situation. Where ideas come to force is in flexible openings where you can often put two or more ideas together to create complicated patterns of pressure. In this game you were patient which should serve you well if this is your general tendency. Suggestion #3: Lost games are more valuable than won games for learning (analyzing a won game is not as useful). Compile a file of lost games (50 or more) and examine them for common errors. This will include where the error was made (keep a close look out for transitions). When you see a (+)losing[+] move try to figure out the circumstances that brought you to this place. Some losing moves are a result of a series of bad ideas or a lack of understanding the position. You can frame your wins. Suggestion #4: Force yourself to calculate one more move.

Against a more experienced opponent, the game's outcome might have been different. The move h4 further weakens White's position. Here are some suggestions:

1. Improve positional understanding, especially the use of minor pieces like bishops, which have been underutilized.
2. Explore more flexible openings like Torre or Colle - Zukertort that can offer multiple strategic options.
3. Analyze lost games to identify common mistakes and learn from them.

 (Reformulation of a series of chess comments)
Here is the context:
                     'In this match, we have Fischer, Bobby (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black). The last moves were: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6.'
                     You don't have to mention anything about the context in the reformulated comment unless deemed necessary.
                     Here are the comments that you have to reformulate:
                     - 'White's knight on f3 is attacking Black's pawn on e5 and Black's knight on c6 is defending it.'
                     - 'Black's pawn on a6 is a strategic move to challenge White's bishop.'
                     - 'White's bishop on b5 is eyeing the knight on c6, which is a classical Ruy Lopez opening.'

Black's most dangerous piece is the one which can attack Pd4, so Bc1-g5, aiming to trade for Be7, might be very good.

"As I was finishing this book I took part in one of the regular all-Master training tournaments held monthly in the San Francisco area. I found myself paired with a very strong opponent, Mike Arne (2400 FIDE). Since we were due to meet a few weeks later in an IM norm tournament, I decided that I shouldn't play my special preparation for him. Naturally with so much Spielmann on my mind I turned to one of his favorite lines, the Worral Attack in the Spanish Game.

After White develops their knight to c3 and Black develops their knight to c6, White plays knight to f3. Subsequently, Black chooses to develop their bishop to g4, which leads to this current position.

The move played by Black, Bishop to g4, is considered suboptimal in this context. It overextends the bishop, potentially putting it on the long diagonal where it can become a target.

Here are several possibilities: 1) 17...Rc8+ 18.Kb1 Bc5 19.Rhe1 Kd6 20.Bf4+ Kc6 21.Re2 Rhd8; 16.Bf4 Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and black protects everything (J.Polgar-De Jong, Wijk aan Zee 1990), or 2) 17...Bb4 (stopping the check from e1) 18.Kb1 (or 18.a3 Rhc8+ 19.Kb1 Bc5) 18...Rhd8 19.Rd3 Rd7 20.Rc1 Rb8 21.Rc6+ Kf5 22.Ra6 (the pin 22.Rb3 is parried tactically: 22...d4! 23.Bd2 Bxd2 24.Rxb8 d3 25.Rc4 Bh6, and the passed pawn ties down white after d3-d2) 22...Rbb7 23.a3 Be7 - black transfers the bishop to f6, from where it controls the blockading square d4. This is an important factor in the defense of positions like this, with the isolated pawn. Black keeps the equal chances (Brunner-Adorjan, Germany 1990). If white tries 16.Bf4, in order to keep the black king from d6, the black king goes to f5 with tempo. For example, 16...Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and all is well for black (Brunner-Stering, Luxembourg 1989).",TRUE,"

'Black' has several counterstrategies like 'Rc8+', 'Bc5', 'Kd6', 'Bf4+', 'Kc6', 'Re2', 'Rhd8', 'Bb4', 'Rac8+', 'Kb1', 'Ba5', 'Rhd8', 'Rc1', 'Rd7', 'Rc6+', 'Kf5', or 'Ra6' to maintain parity and effectively manage an isolated pawn.

"Many players hammer out the first few moves of the Ruy Lopez (or ""Spanish Game"" as it's sometimes called) without stopping to think about the logic behind them. White, we are told by some opening books, is threatening to remove the defender of Black's e-pawn. But if that's really the threat, then why does Black so often adopt Morphy's idea of 3...a6, immediately daring the Bishop to capture on c6? And why does White so often decline to take?",TRUE,"
The comment correctly explains the common misconception about the Ruy Lopez opening and the logic behind Black's move 3...a6.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5,"This is a game between Gligoric, S (as White) and Bidev, P (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5"," White's move of Bishop to b5 is often criticized because it overlooks the strategic depth of the Ruy Lopez. Black's response of 3...a6 puts pressure on the Bishop, suggesting that White might not be fully grasping the opening's intricacies."
"The answer is that White is not actually threatening -- yet -- to take the N/c6 and grab the e-pawn. Even in the exchange variation 3...a6 4.Bxc6, White's aim is not to win the e-pawn but rather to establish a healthy Kingside pawn majority, at the cost of the two Bishops. 4...dxc6 The punishment for grabbing on e5 is a swift equalization of the position: 5.Nxe5 Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2. Notice the resulting pawn structure. White and Black each have four pawns on the Queenside. In this kind of pawn formation, White cannot force a passed pawn: Black's ""crippled"" Queenside holds White's ""healthy"" set of four easily. So Black has the Bishop pair essentially for free. Unfortunately, it's almost inevitable that everything will be exchanged down the e-file (both sides will rush to occupy this with Rooks) with an early draw the likely result. So instead of playing 4.Bxc6 as a means of ""winning"" the e-pawn, White sometimes plays the exchange variation in order to trade his own d-pawn for Black's e-pawn. That is a different matter entirely: 5.0-0 Bd6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 This sort of position -- with or without the exchange of Queens -- affords White more winning chances. Now White's pawn majority is on the Kingside, and that makes a huge difference. Experience shows that Black's pair of Bishops is just about adequate compensation for White's pawn majority. But this line can definitely be played for something other than a stone-cold draw, as Fischer proved numerous times. Nevertheless, the resulting positions often lack the dynamism of a full-board struggle. In our game, Gligoric chooses a time-honored move that remains the main line of the Ruy Lopez: 4.Ba4 It's instructive to keep track of time in the opening. White is moving the Bishop for the second time, but this isn't really a net loss in development since Black's move ...a6 hardly counts for much in the way of time. White remains, then, half a tempo ahead. I can hear the faint sound of heads being scratched. ""Half a tempo? How do you get half of a tempo? A move is a move, you can't have half of a move!"" Not to leave you wondering, here's my modest contribution toward the theory of time in the opening. In the initial position of chess, White is thought to have a slight advantage. But why? The position is, after all, symmetrical. White's only advantage is that it is his turn to move. Now, it would violate logic if White, who has this theoretical advantage, were to stand worse after using it in the best possible way. Therefore, I propose to count having the turn to move as being worth half of a tempo. Consider: After 1.e4, White has moved -- and gets a full tempo for that. But it is now Black's turn to play, and so Black gets back half a tempo. The net difference? One half of a tempo, just as it was before White moved. Skip forward now to the point where White has played 4.Ba4. White has three useful moves on the board that affect, directly or indirectly, the center: P/e4, N/f3, B/a4 (threatening Black's Knight, though at the moment that threat doesn't carry much bite). Black has only two: N/c6 and P/e5. However, it is Black's turn to move. So White has retained his half-tempo lead. (White gets 3 tempi, one for each ""good"" move. Black gets two for ""good"" moves and another half-tempo for its being his turn to move.)",TRUE,"

The comment explains the mistake by discussing the consequences of White's move 4.Bxc6 and the alternatives, showing that the player misunderstood the strategic implications of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4,"This is a game between Gligoric, S (as White) and Bidev, P (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to a4"," The answer, they contend, is that White is not actually threatening to capture the N/c6 and seize the e-pawn. In the exchange variation, after 3...a6 and 4...dxc6, White's goal isn't to win the e-pawn but to build a strong Kingside pawn majority, even though it means sacrificing two Bishops. After 4...dxc6, the position can quickly equalize: 5.Nxe5 Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2. The resulting pawn structure leads to a balanced position, with four pawns on the Queenside for both sides.

It's an interesting strategic decision for White to trade their d-pawn for Black's e-pawn, seeking an advantage in the Kingside pawn majority. However, this often results in a more static position, where Black's Bishop pair can be utilized effectively.

White's position is slightly better due to more available moves, but the advantage is reduced since it's Black's turn next, balancing the tempo."
"A third move by the Bishop, but again, obviously forced: White retains the advantage in Time conferred on him by the first move. Of course, there's also the interesting question of Black's pawns on a6 and b5 -- are they strong or weak? Whoever can answer that question understands the mysteries of the Ruy Lopez. Black cannot get away with an immediate chase of the Bishop -- his e-pawn is hanging, and he is not in a position to regain it. So he must either sacrifice it by ...0-0 (the Marshall Attack) or else defend it, as Bidev does here.",TRUE,"

Last move played: White plays Bishop to b3"," White's third move with the Bishop to b3 was not forced and suggests White maintains the advantage due to the initial first move. The position of Black's pawns on a6 and b5 is critical; it's unclear if they are strong or weak. Black cannot immediately pursue the Bishop but must choose a strategy. Black's decision to defend rather than sacrifice the e-pawn, as Bidev does here, shows a more cautious approach."
"This move constitutes a positional threat to the B/b3: Black now intends ...Na5, both aiming at the Bishop and freeing his c-pawn for duty in the center. This gives me an opportunity to clear up another little mystery. Many players learn early on to identify Bishops as ""bad"" or ""good,"" according to whether they do or do not bump into their own center pawns. By that criterion, of course, White's B/b3 is ""bad"" -- it's on a light square, as is White's principal pawn in the center on e4. But that isn't really the point. The important thing is that White's Bishop is active. The designation ""bad"" is only useful insofar as it denotes a Bishop that is well and truly restricted by its pawns. Black's Bishop on e7 is, at this point, unequivocally bad. But neither of White's Bishops is inactive like the poor creature on e7. That is why White now takes time to preserve his Bishop and increase his control over the center, particularly the d4 square.",TRUE,"

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6"," Black's move to d6 opens the possibility of...Na5, which targets the White Bishop on b3 and frees the c-Pawn for central action. This move creates a tactical situation that can be exploited. It's a common misconception that a Bishop's value is determined solely by whether it's on a light or dark square, as well as whether it's near its own central Pawns. The critical factor is actual activity. White's Bishop on b3 is active, while Black's Bishop on e7 is restricted and, thus, considered ""bad."" White is taking time to reinforce their Bishop's position and exert greater control over the center, particularly over the d4 square."
"This move, which can be found in tens of thousands of grandmaster games, is liable to be baffling. Isn't it almost always a bad waste of time to move one's Rook's pawn in the opening? And isn't it particularly weakening when done in front of one's King?? Yet the move has a sound strategic objective that is squarely focused in the center. White wants the option of creating a strong center with a subsequent d4. If Black is allowed to play ...Bg4, the pin on White's N/f3 will reduce White's control of d4 -- the more so since Black, by capturing on f3, not only eliminates one defender of d4 but also draws away the Queen, thereby at a single blow reducing White's control of d4 by two.",TRUE,"

It's risky to advance the h-pawn early, as it can weaken the King's position. This move might sound like a mistake, but it serves a strategic purpose: it aims to prepare for control of the center with d4. However, if Black responds with...Bg4, it creates pressure on White's knight and queen, which could weaken White's hold on the d4 square."
"An interesting parting of the ways. Gligoric could very well play d4 here -- his previous play has been designed to make it possible.

"Superficially, Black's position looks fine. He controls four ranks of the board to White's three: his pieces seem tolerably active, and it's hard to believe that disaster is about to strike. To get beyond superficial assessments, let's look at some less obvious factors. First, mentally draw lines from White's Bishops up the diagonals. They're aimed in the right direction, and they will both be ready to let fly when White (as is unstoppable) plays d4. Second, look at the square f5. Wouldn't that make a lovely location for a Knight? Black, by exposing his Queen on d5, has given White a free tempo for swinging a Knight up there. It is hard to believe it, but at this point Black is probably already lost. The time he spent repositioning his Knight to c5 -- where it has virtually no bearing on Kingside defense and is in fact an embarrassment -- comes back to haunt him.",TRUE,"

In this simplified comment, I avoided mentioning any player's name and used 'they/them/their' to refer to the player. I also followed the instruction to use 'White' or 'Black' to indicate the player's color, which helped maintain clarity and focus on the chess move analysis without additional context."

This instruction has been reformulated to focus solely on the description of the move, indicating that the placement of the bishop by Black might be considered as potentially weak or risky without any additional context.

"# I think Tarrasch was quite happy with the opening results: White has a small but constant advantage, and there are chances to increase it without any risk.

And so he moves his rook contrary to all rules of conventional wisdom: Ich glaube, dass Tarrasch mit dem Ergebnis aus der Eroeffnung recht zufrieden gewesen ist: Weiss hat einen kleinen, aber anhaltenden Vorteil, und es gibt Moeglichkeiten, diesen Vorteil ohne Risiko zu vergroessern. Man kann vermuten, dass Tarrasch vielleicht einen Zug wie 15... Sf8 erwartete, wonach er 16.Sd4 mit wachsendem Druck geplant haben duerfte. Lasker wusste indes, dass der beste Weg, eine lange, qualvolle Verteidigung zu vermeiden, darin bestand, den Gegner aus seiner zufriedenen Stimmung herauszureissen.

A more promising consideration would be the move 14/\Bxf3. If Black responds with Ne5, followed by Qf5, White can play 15. Qxf3, after which 16.

This move makes sense but the Bishop does not belong here in this set up. The Bishop will go to d6 and the Queen Knight will plant itself on d7.

"This is known as a ""lever."" The threatened exchange forms an advantage at that spot for the one who created it. Meanwhile the one who liquidates it generally is at the disadvantage. Thus, Black will want to create as much pressure on d4 and the c - file before liquidating the lever. This is one of the ""subtleties"" of pawn play. Another way to do this with advantage would be to play 14...Rc8 first. For instance, 14...Rc8 15.Qc2 Nxd2 16.Nxd2 c5 17.Ne4 Bb8 18.Rfd1 cxd4 19.Rxd4 Be5 20.Rd2 Qc7 21.Ng3 Nb6 22.Bd3 Qxc2 23.Rxc2 Rxc2 24. Bxc2 Rd8.

Another option for White that might lead to a slight advantage involves a different sequence of moves.

"Interesting contradiction in chess ideas. Technically White has managed to exchange off the ""bad"" Bishop, almost unforced.

"The computer finally reaches it threshold of pain and does the only sensible thing. Nice job. Prescription for improvement: First, your Endgame play is weak. As you get stronger (and your opponents get stronger) this will become a critical component of your game. Also it is a way to clip stronger players, if you can get to a superior Endgame. Most players focus on the Opening and Middlegame but if you get to the Endgame, you'll acquire a nice collection of scalps. Second, either switch to playing 1. e4 (good idea if you are under 1500) or burn the midnight oil on the positional aspect of the game. This game was positional, and you did well for the most part. If you can major on this and become the most boring chessnut in your neck of the woods, people will fear playing you. Once you get the positional ideas down, then you can work on the tactical. Generally the tactical aspect of the game is easier because it involves learning patterns and does not take much planning. It is one thing to capitalize on an opponent's mistake, it is another (much more satisfying event) to create the mistake that leads to the wonder combination. If this doesn't appeal to you watch a cat the next time it hunts. The cat doesn't mind the time it takes to stalk its prey. Nor does it have any scruples about playing with its helpless opponent before turning it into food. Just remember it's a game.

The reason is that all pawn moves change the game, forever. You can move any piece back and forth, but when a pawn moves it can't go back. Thus you see the permanent nature of the pawn move. Many players in your class tend to be afraid of ""shadow"" threats (/\Bg5). Silman's rule is ""if you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it."" Lasker urged, ""defend with as little effort as possible."" Typically this pin is an illusion, especially before a person castles. It's only real purpose is to control the dark squares on the Kingside (and possibly the center). a2-a3 Having protected the Kingside, you now seal off the Queenside. While this seems prudent you must remember a simple idea. Now repeat after me, ""always play in the center."" Remind yourself that if you do not play in the center you will spend eternity attempting to win the E class at your local tournament. It is a simple concept, but it is amazing how few of us catch on to it. Only play on the side if there is a GM approved reason. f4-d2 Not bad but it is a waste of a good move.

"b5xd7+ I'm not a fan. Typically when you are up the idea is to avoid exchanges in favor of building pressure. Then there is the idea that once a material advantage is obtained trade into oblivion.

O-O Allowing Black to equalize immediately. Black has all sorts of weaknesses and while you can castle you do not have to castle! I know we preach that you should castle as soon as possible but that is only part of the idea. The complete context is to castle as soon as safely possible with a reason. In other words, play with the end in mind. Play with a plan. What does the position demand? 18.Bc3! attacks Black's confused Kingside. g8-e7 a1-e1 e6-e5 d4-f3 e7-f5?

Typically, when one is in a favorable position, it's better to avoid material exchanges unless they're strategically sound. Building pressure and going for material gain without sufficient understanding can lead to a disadvantage. It's crucial to have experience to know when to trade and how to secure an advantageous endgame position. This move showed a lack of confidence and was a missed opportunity to capitalize on the advantage.

By allowing Black to equalize, they enabled Black to initiate a counterattack. It is important to consider castling as soon as it's safe, not because you should always castle but because it's a part of a broader strategy.

The move 18.Bc3! can be seen as a good strategy, as it puts pressure on Black's position. Black's response with g8-e7 doesn't help.

"e2-f1 f7-f3 g3xf3+ h4-g4 f3-g3+ g4-f4 g3xg7 f4-f3 g7-f7+ f3-e4 e3-e2 Coaches Advice: Your road to chess improvement is through Karpov and his type. You must become addicted to ""positional"" chess. You attacked when you should not have, you traded when you should not have, and you castled when you had a much better move. Study Silman's ""How to Reassess your Chess"" (easily the most useful book on chess in the last 200 years), ""The Amateur's Mind,"" and ""How to/ \ Workbook. "" In a sense, I'm asking you to go back to ""square one"" and relearn the game. The idea is to teach you to play with a plan. It is said that a ""bad"" plan is better than no plan. When I say plan, it's not a legalism that controls every thought. But there are some basic ideas like knowing when to attack and when to defend that are critical. The cool part about this is once you have the positional ideas down, you can attack like a mad dog when the position calls for it. If you don't know then you will not pull off the brilliant attacks when they are available. One piece of advice that will add 200 points to your playing strength right now. ALWAYS (unless there is a specific GM approved reason) PLAY IN THE CENTER! If you lose the center, you lose the game. The center controls the game. The center is your brain, you lose your brain/\. OK you get the picture. You will be surprised when you get this one concept down with a passion that you will be able to play with anybody. (Or at least you will get that feeling.) You will also be alegitimate threat to anyone (just don't look at the rating, it messes with your mind). While you are doing this, consider what openings you do well when playing. While 1.Nf3 is a very good opening you must understand the ideas behind what you are attempting to accomplish with it. Many players are looking for a win in the first 10 moves. If this is you then 1.Nf3 is not our opening. If you are real good at endgames then your best route is probably 1.e4 (assuming you can live through the typically violent middle games). If you like positional chess then head for the closed games you find in 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.d4. 1.f4. If you really like odd ideas stick to 1.c4 (English) and 1.f4 (Bird) but I wouldn't stray beyond those (possibly 1.Nc3 the Dunst is playable.) The reason for this advice is that many players like an opening, for whatever reason, and do poorly in it (typically because they 1. Do not understand it. 2. Do not feel comfortable in the game. 3. Are not capable of grasping the concepts). For instance, I attempted to play the Modern Benoni and was constantly beaten. My problem is that I did not have the maturity in the areas that were necessary to play the opening. Nothing personal, but the Benoni lived up to its name (son of my sorrow). Meanwhile they rule with an opening that they, for whatever reason, do not like. I used to play the English but abandoned it for more popular openings. A while back I did an inventory and discovered that I did well in English type positions and won 80% of my games. So when I'm in an important game that I want to win, what opening do I play? (Hint: It's not 1.e4!) e4-d3",TRUE,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake in the move e4-d3 as a lack of understanding of the concepts necessary for success in the game, such as knowing when to attack and when to defend, and suggests that the player should focus on learning positional chess and playing in the center, which are essential for becoming a stronger player.",1. Nf3 f6 2. Nc3 c6 3. d4 d5 4. Bf4 c5 5. dxc5 a6 6. h3 h5 7. h4,This is a game between W45 (as White) and B45 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h4," 'Black' played the move Pawn to h4. This move is considered poor for several reasons. First, the move does not contribute to the control of the center, which is crucial in chess. A strong opening principle involves controlling the center, particularly with pawns, as it allows for greater mobility of pieces and can restrict the opponent's options. This move by 'Black' offers little in terms of central control and pawn structure. Additionally, the move may weaken 'Black's' king position by neglecting the development of minor pieces, which are essential for both attacking and defending. A strong game is built on a solid foundation of piece development and pawn structure, and this move does not align with those principles. Coaches should advise focusing on moves that improve the position and piece activity, rather than making disjointed advances that lack strategic purpose."

Following 10...Qxd1, 11.Rxd1, and 12.Bc6+ Kf8, Black faces a challenging position. Despite having material equality, their pieces are lacking good squares, and White appears to be ready to advance along the d-file. For instance, after 13.Be3, Bb7, and 14.Bxb7, Black's rook ends up on b7, and White prepares to bring their rook to d1 with Rad1, further intensifying the pressure on Black.

However, this simplistic interpretation overlooks the long-term positional disadvantages for Black. By forcing the King to move to f8 (Kf8), Black's position becomes less coordinated, hampering piece mobility and complicating the development of their remaining forces. This move, rather than presenting immediate tactical threats, actually sets the stage for future positional struggles for Black, indicating the importance of considering the dynamic potential of the position beyond initial tactical considerations."
"Despite the awkwardness of it, Shapiro should have taken with the Bishop. But he reasons thus: why not take with the pawn and get rid of that pesky N/e5 once and for all? Now if White backs up the Knight, Black can play f5, Nf6, Qd7 and 0-0-0 -- he might even be able to use the g-file for an attack on White's King later on. Even ugly moves can give victory if they are not met resolutely. Fortunately for us, resolute play is Najdorf's strong suit! Can you guess what he uncorks here?",TRUE,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, noting the missed opportunity to capture the knight with the bishop, and highlighting the strategic possibilities that could have arisen from such a move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f6," Shapiro played pawn to f6, a move that seems unorthodox. Despite this, Shapiro reasons that taking with the bishop is less effective, considering that the pawn's capture would deal with the troublesome N/e5 piece. However, this move leaves the e5 pawn open, which could be a significant weakness. If White responds by moving their knight, Shapiro's plan to advance with f5, develop the knight, place the queen on d7, and castle long could work. There's also a chance to utilize the g-file for a future assault. Nonetheless, Najdorf, who is typically resilient in such situations, might respond with strong counterplay, potentially turning the tables."
Let your imagination run wild and you will see that Nxf7 has all the earmarks of an excellent investment. First point: it's an offer Black can't refuse.,FALSE,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it incorrectly praises the move as potentially good, while it is widely considered a blunder in chess.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Second point: White has at least a perpetual check now, since if nothing else he can keep going from g4-h5-g4+. Black can never set his King on a dark square or Bh6+ will be the end of him. For example: 11...Kg7 12.Bh6+ Kg8 13.Qg4+ Here's a delightful little line. 13...Kf7 14.Qg7+ Ke8 Now taking the Rook allows Black to play Nf8. Can you see a better idea? 15.Qg6+!! (15.Bg6+ hxg6 16.Qxg6#) 15...hxg6 16.Bxg6# Same effect, but a little more glamourous this way.",TRUE,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential for perpetual check and the endgame possibility for White.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5.

Last move played: White plays Queen to h5 with check," White's attempt at creating perpetual check is flawed. By playing Qh5, White doesn't leave Black with any escape squares, causing a checkmate threat if Black fails to respond correctly. Black has no option but to move the King to a dark square, like Kg7. However, White can still continue the sequence with g4 and h5, forcing Black into a position where the King cannot avoid capture. Black's only hope is to move pieces like Nf8 to try and break free. Yet, White has a smarter continuation with Qxg6+, which is more elegant and still results in a checkmate. This move exploits Black's lack of adequate defenses and showcases White's superior tactical skills."
"All of that demonstrates why Black must not put his King on a dark square. So we know, already, that White has at least a perpetual check in hand any time he wants it.Najdorf, of course, wants a good deal more than that. Now it's a sad but true fact that with the material aimed at the King right now, White cannot deliver checkmate. How can he best get another heavy piece into action? It will take a few moves to get a rook into action. Nevertheless, Najdorf starts the process.",TRUE,"

Last move played: Black plays King to g8," In this situation, Black's move to g8 is a mistake because they should avoid putting their King on a dark square. White is in a position to initiate a perpetual check at any moment. The material around the White King is not sufficient for a checkmate, but White can improve their position by getting another heavy piece, like a rook, into the game. This process will take a few moves, and White is already starting to think about how to achieve this."

"He offered to shed an entire Rook to relieve the immediate pressure. Najdorf, however, knows what to do with an open line.",TRUE,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the player's offer to exchange a Rook for a minor piece (likely a Knight or Bishop) was a risky move, considering Najdorf's expertise in exploiting open lines.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move allowed the opponent to gain tempo by attacking the weakened kingside, and a better move would have been to exploit the exposed position of the white bishop.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Moving an already-developed piece once again. One may be thinking it's attacking the bishop so it's all right, but in this position due to black's open king and his newly undefended bishop, Tim came up with a tactic that gains considerable advantage while eliminating black's right to castle. It must be said, however, that if Black continues correctly he could establish a strong knight at d5. However, in the opening, there usually isn't time for these kind of maneuvers. Tim suggested 1. 0Ra5 or 10. g5 ascreatingcounterplay for Black. He didn't provide the line for 10, g5 which leaves me speculative, but I agree with 10. a5 for sure. Though 10. g5 11. a3 Ba5 12.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to e7," Tim suggests that White's Knight move to e7 isn't ideal. This action doesn't attack the Bishop properly. With Black's King on the open file and a new, unprotected Bishop, White has a tactical opportunity. Tim's advice is to play 1. Rh5 or 1. g5, aiming to create problems for Black. However, we lack Tim's full plan for 1. g5. Tim prefers 1. a5, agreeing it's a good counterplay. If Black plays 11... Ba5, White can go 12. Nh4, and if Black captures the Knight with 12... Bxd2+, White can play 13. Kxd2 and then Black might play 13... g4, which looks promising for Black."
"This move does not help development nor does as much constructive work as it would've done on move 10. This is black's first major mistake. Tim mentioned to me that, ""13. b6 was undoubtedly the best move because 13. d6 fails due to the fact it opens up the position while the black king is in the center and 13. d5 obviously fails because it produces the well-protected passed e-pawn that's ready to push after 14. 0-0 and 15.

Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White tends to attack on the Kingside, while Black aims at the Queenside. Control these and win.

This tends to come from lack of experience and lack of knowing basic attacking motifs. Second, you don't seem to understand the idea of the opening. (Very few do, in OTB. Play postal and you will learn the ideas very quickly or lose badly, quickly.) I would suggest that you switch to the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on your positional awareness. Work on the common tactical ideas, learn patterns. Maybe one thing that will help you in the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a ""change up"" style (what you pull out for fun or when you've been scouted at a tourney). This will add spice (not to mention confusion) to your opponent's life. If you want to work on your positional understanding, study the games of Karpov - who just happens to be creative attacker.

Qxe6, where Black's pawns are attacked and they become vulnerable. Qe7 could result in Bg3 e4 23. Qh5, putting Black in a tough situation. Both options show that Black had viable defenses. White's play demonstrated a lack of aggression and understanding of opening principles, which are crucial even for experienced players. They should consider studying the Queen's Gambit to utilize their positional strength and focus on tactical patterns and common motifs. Learning from Karpov's games and Silman's ""How to Reassess"" could improve their strategic approach. They need to develop a more attacking mindset and enhance their opening knowledge."

This move by Black is unexpected. Normally, Black would avoid trading off the Knight to prevent White from developing the Bishop and preparing for a queenside offensive. Yet, in this instance, it looks like Black might be prioritizing developing their queen's side before White's planned Bc1-e3 and Nc3-e4-c5.

Black's last move is uncommon. Black typically tries to keep the Bishop on the board rather than trading it for a Knight. In this scenario, it seems Black is focusing on organizing their queen's side in anticipation of White's upcoming moves Bc1-e3 and Nc3-e4-c5.

Taking possession of d4 protecting his knight thus making it more secure and opening the line of his queen bishop.,FALSE,"

Bb3, maintaining a strong presence on the board and keeping an eye on Black's position."
The prelude to an enterprising knight sacrifice which Anderssen however with ingenious play refutes.,FALSE,"

The comment does not seem to explain the mistake made by the player, as it mentions a potential strategy (knight sacrifice) that was not executed, suggesting an alternative play rather than the mistake itself.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

Be3.",1. d4,"This is a game between Beliavsky, Alexander GM (as White) and Nunn, John GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," White's 6th move is a deviation from the Saemisch variation of the King's Indian Defense. By playing Be3, White neglects the main ideas of the Saemisch, such as preparing for a strong central pawn push with g3 and Bg2, and not allowing Black to establish a strong pawn center with d5. The move 6...c6 by Black also gains time by preparing to develop the light-squared bishop outside the pawn chain, challenging White's control over the d4-square."

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting an alternative and better move, referencing Seirawan-Istratescu's game from 1994, which demonstrates that Nh3-f2 could have been a superior choice for White, leading to a more favorable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

A mistake. The move is logically designed to prevent black's Knights from going to g4 after white plays the natural f4 to drive away black's Knight on e5. Few better moves spring to mind for white here. 9. Bd3 Nxd3 uncoordinates the white position. 9. Ne2? Nxc4 loses material. Watch how black immediately targets the weakened g3 square.,TRUE,"

Black immediately capitalizes on the weakened g3 square.'"
This move invites the Pawn fork which sacrifices black material for no clear tactical advantage. After the natural 11... gxf5 12. f4 Ng6 13. g3 would make black's Knights harmless. White is nearly forced to fork the black pieces in order to develop his own pieces.,TRUE,"

After 11... gxf5, White's natural response of f4 followed by g3 would render Black's Knights inactive. White is left with little choice but to create a fork, which is not an advantageous position."
"The point of this entire line of sacrifice is made with this move. The white King is stuck in the center. Castling Queenside would run into Bh6 immediately. White finds it difficult to develop his kingside pieces. Black has the initiative with the f-file battery. Therefore, white will find it hard to devise a defensive plan.",TRUE,"

The comment accurately highlights the weaknesses in white's position, such as the central King's vulnerability, the difficulties in kingside development, and the control of the f-file by black, thus explaining the potential mistake made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.
