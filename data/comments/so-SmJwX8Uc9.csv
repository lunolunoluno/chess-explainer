This is a major opening error. This pawn move does not aid in development and blocks the best King Knight move. It does not develop a piece. It does not control central squares (1...f5 for instance does). It creates weakness on the Kingside.,True," The comment directly identifies key weaknesses in the move's strategic impact and development, indicating a significant error.",1.

"Interesting and ""correct."" Unfortunately ""correct"" in chess is not always the ""best."" When an opponent is cobbled up like this ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! Here 4.e4 leads to a significant advantage due to White's central control and Black's lack of development.",True," The comment highlights a crucial point about the limitations of simply claiming a move is ""correct"" in a tactical situation, particularly against aggressive opponents.",1.

"""Lasker's rule"" states: ""Always distrust a pawn move."" The reason is that all pawn moves change the game, forever. You can move any piece back and forth, but when a pawn moves it can't go back. Thus you see the permanent nature of the pawn move. Many players in your class tend to be afraid of ""shadow"" threats (...Bg5). Silman's rule is ""if you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it."" Lasker urged, ""defend with as little effort as possible."" Typically this pin is an illusion, especially before a person castles. It's only real purpose is to control the dark squares on the Kingside (and possibly the center).",True," The comment provides a rationale for the mistake, suggesting a misunderstanding of pawn structure and the potential for illusory threats.",1.

"Having protected the Kingside, you now seal off the Queenside. While this seems prudent you must remember a simple idea. Now repeat after me, ""always play in the center."" Remind yourself that if you do not play in the center you will spend eternity attempting to win the E class at your local tournament. It is a simple concept, but it is amazing how few of us catch on to it. Only play on the side if there is a GM approved reason.",True," The comment offers a concise explanation of why the move was a mistake, highlighting the importance of central control and the potential for future frustration.",1.

"Not bad but it is a waste of a good move. Why did you put your bishop on f4 to begin with? To control the middle? To control the Queenside? Well, then what is it doing on d2? You have just wasted a good wish (to get to move twice in a game - here was that extra move you wanted). If you were to play Bg3/h2 then you could still do the control thing.",True," The comment offers a specific critique of the bishop's placement, highlighting a potential strategic error and suggesting a better alternative.",1.

"Count the pawn moves your opponent has made so far. Because the game remains closed Black survives 60 moves longer than he should have. When you see this many pointless moves from your opponent, show no mercy. Go after him, sacrifice material to open lines if you have to.

"I'm not a fan. Typically when you are up the idea is to avoid exchanges in favor of building pressure. Then there is the idea that once a material advantage is obtained trade into oblivion. It takes experience to know which to employ and when. The key to this is to know how to win an endgame. When you can go into a ""won"" endgame, but all means go for it! The fewer pieces in the middle game the easier the defense - typically. This move shows lack of confidence.

"Allowing Black to equalize immediately. Black has all sorts of weaknesses and while you can castle you do not have to castle!
