Good.

"? Definitely bad. White should try to castle as soon as possible. Also, in the opening, it's best to develop with attack. 6 Bc4! would be the way to do it (threatens black's knight at d5).

"When having the option, it is generally better to capture TOWARD the center of the board. Hence bxc6 is preferred. In addition, this would give black an excellent post for his queen bishop on a6.

"White misses a strong defence: Qc3! That would a) defend the e-pawn b) block the check c) threaten black's queen.

"Remember: Using ALL of your chessmen is always more effective. White could've played the correct O-O, and after Rad1, Rfe1, ALL of his pieces would be active, while black has a hemmed in light-squared bishop.

"Good. This preserves the bishop pair. Bishops control more squares on an open board. You could check this for yourself. Put 2 knights on an empty board in the center, and they can go to 16 squres.
