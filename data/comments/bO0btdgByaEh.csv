"While this plan is sound, white can get a slight pull by playing 8. cxd5 cxd5 9. Qb3 e6 (...Nb6 10. Ne5) 10. Bd2, and white can gain c-file occupatio first. Probably 7. ... dxc4 8.

"? Definitely wrong. If white was planning this, he never should've posted his queen on c2, because now the lady will be exposed for free tempos by black.

"An automatic move...this connects rooks, but that's about it. Instead Qd2 is stronger. This would prevent blacks' queen from infiltrating b4, help insure white can contest the c-file (since the Q would be covering c1), and indirectly hinders an e5 break by black (because the black d-pawn would be hit by white's queen and bishop. Also, ...Bg4, followed by ...Bxf3, gxf3 is not dangerous for white. Remember: a weakness is only a weakness if it can be taken advantage of!

"? Now black mobilizes his pawns, white's bishop is bad, and will activate black's bishop as well, not to mention undoubling black's pawns for him. Because of the opposite colored bishops, white could put a much stiffer reistance by playing 21. Qd3 Rfc8 22. Rcd1!, and black has no access points (c2 is covered by the light squared bishop), and no way to boot white's bishop. Note that even if black sac'd his rook on c4 at some point, white doesn't even have to take it! Also, the d-line pressure would discourage a ...e5 break by black.

"A well-played game by black...black made the most of his opportunities. With this game, it's hard to answer your question about strength...white made a number of positional errors, and black could be anywhere from an A-class player to grandmaster. I need more games to make a better evaluation in that regard. White played approx. B-player strength. Keep at it, and always go over any losses/draws you experience, so you can learn and improve even more.",True," The comment offers a subjective assessment of the move's quality and suggests a need for further analysis, indicating a potential concern about the playerâ€™s performance.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.
