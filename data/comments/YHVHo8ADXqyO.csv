"A continuation which is believed less strong that the theoretical 4.O-O but, however, must be treated with respect.",False,"

The comment is not directly explaining the mistake made by the player. It seems to be highlighting the player's choice between two moves, but it doesn't clearly state what the problem is with the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
A developing move but...not very aggressive,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting that while the move may have been purposeful for development, it lacked aggressiveness.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"
"(!) Bird is not afraid of Steinitz threat to replace the Knight in c5 with the Bishop, and with the intention to exploit the position of his opponent's King, he continues with his attacking plan.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by stating that the opponent's (Steinitz's) threat to replace the Knight in c5 with the Bishop was not adequately addressed, allowing the opponent to continue their attacking plan.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f5"
"""Do you want a Rook? Just take it!""",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the player's mistake, as it lacks specific information about the move that was played and why it was considered a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e4"
"""Did you take it? Good. Do you think that now I want to take your Rook in a8? You are wrong!""",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that they took an opportunity to capture a Rook but realized it was a poor move after further consideration.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black).

(!),True,"

The comment ""(!)"" effectively indicates that a mistake was made, with the exclamation point adding emphasis to the error.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f6"
It seems that Steinitz want to keep all the advantages he has apparently obtained.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only mentions Steinitz's intention to maintain his advantages, without specifying the error of the move itself.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Rb8,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b8"
"It looks like a mistake, and probably it is. Maybe is it a ""terroristic"" move?",True,"

The comment accurately explains the poor quality of the move, comparing it to a ""terroristic"" move, which suggests a significant error or an intentional aggressive move that can lead to a disadvantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Rb8 14. e6,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e6"
(??) the move that such a terrorist as was Bird reached its purpose.,True,"

The comment implies that the move was deliberate and strategically planned, suggesting it was not a mistake but a strong move made by the player named Bird.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Rb8 14. e6 Rg8,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to g8"
+- (?) What a pity! Taken by euphoria of a close victory Bird does not see a beautiful mate in three.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player missed a mate in three, likely due to excitement about a near victory.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8.

Last move played: White plays Queen takes on h7"
The King is dying.,True,"

The comment ""The King is dying"" accurately describes the mistake made by the player, likely referring to a situation where the King has been left exposed or vulnerable to an attack.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Rb8 14. e6 Rg8 15. Qxh7 Rf8 16. exf7+ Rxf7 17. Re1+,"This is a game between Bird, Henry (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1 with check"
A beatiful mate!,True,"

This comment indicates that the move led to a checkmate, which is typically seen as a mistake since the opponent's king would be in checkmate and losing the game, but the commenter seems to be using sarcasm or irony to highlight the poor move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 Nxa1 12. f6 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Rb8 14. e6 Rg8 15. Qxh7 Rf8 16. exf7+ Rxf7 17. Re1+ Be7 18.
