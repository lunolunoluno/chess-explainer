"Wow, now this is something interesting. I've seen a New In Chess magazine theoretical article on 6. Qf3 and played 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qf3, but I've never seen it played after 6. Be3. The idea is usually to allow O-O-O without having Qd2 blocking the d-file and to be able to meet ...e6-e5 with Nd4-f5 (and possibly ...g7-g6 with Nf5-e3, so putting Be3 seems odd. It's weakness is that it blocks Pf2 from immediately moving to f4, so that means Black can use square e5 or at least he doesn't have to worry much about e4-e5.",True," The comment provides a relevant theoretical context and analysis of a specific move choice, indicating a potential misunderstanding of strategic principles.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Yes, it prevents g2-g4, but what does Ke8 have to say about it? Does he feel safer now? I think Adams would be happy to have another weakness he can play against, without having extended his own position; just so he doesn't lose Qf3 because of it's exposure.",True,", The comment raises a valid concern about the impact of the move on the opponent's potential plans and suggests a tactical advantage for the player.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This move is slightly effective. It prevents ...b7-b5, so that after ...b7-b6 Pa6 will still need a defender. It also indicates White won't be castling to the queen-side and if he goes king-side one has to ask, ""Is Qf3 well placed?""",True," The comment offers a potential justification for the mistake, suggesting a defensive strategy and a need for careful pawn structure evaluation.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Adams is slowly rearranging his pieces to suit his needs in regard to playing against the slightly odd Black position. He might yet O-O and play f2-f4, but he is wisely repositioning his queen to prevent ...Nd7-c5 from being effective. Of course, that doesn't prevent ...Nd7-e5-c4.",True," The comment suggests a strategic adjustment to mitigate a specific tactical threat, indicating a potential mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Kasparov was fully prepared to have his Ng4 captured. With or without that he was hitting Ph2, so that ...d6-d5 could clear the way for ...Qc7xh2#. He wasn't going to ...O-O anyway, so this just gives Rh8 a way to play. That Black gains the two bishops is probably incidental, but may prove useful later.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic miscalculation and a potential future tactical advantage.",1. e4 c5 2.

"And this is the result. Pe4 is en prise and Ph2 is very weak; if Black were to double rooks on the h-file it would probably fall. The open f-file isn't so bad for Black. He could play ...f7-f6 in a pinch, but Pg4 is quite weak. One Black advantage which could easily be overlooked is that his king is centralized and would be better in an endgame (I think the current situation is too complicated to be called an endgame and neither king would feel safe playing offensively) .",True," The comment provides specific reasoning for the mistake, suggesting a tactical weakness and a potential endgame advantage for Black.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This was certainly one of the more curious oddly intricate games. It might have been the game of the tournament if he'd played 26. Nxe4 and went on to win.
