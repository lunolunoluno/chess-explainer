"This move co ntraddicts the strategical principles indicated by the theory. Since Turn knew that Mikenas had a deep theoretical preparation, he decided this line of play in order to surprise the opponent.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only provides background information about the opponent's preparation, rather than analyzing the specific move that was played.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to f3"
A bit inaccurate. The following continuation would have lead to interesting complications: 6. Bd2 Bb7 7. Qg3 O-O 8. d5,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a potential mistake by the player, suggesting a better alternative that could have led to more engaging positional play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3"
White hoped in the reply 7. .. 0-0 8.Ne2 with initiative on the kingside after 9.e4.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights White's misguided aim to gain initiative on the kingside after 9.e4, which can be considered a strategic error in the given position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6"
"In fact, the capture 8. Qxg7 after 8... Rg8 9. Qh6 Rxg2 would have given a very promising position to Black.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests an alternative move for Black rather than addressing the error in the original move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"
"An energetic reply, revealing Mikenas character in that period: enthusiasm, courage and imagination. Which is the general strategy of the young people: attack, and don't care about possible losses.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it actually praises the player's energetic and aggressive playing style.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
The right continuation even if comes from intuition rather than calculation. The consequences of 11... Rxg2 12. Qxg2 Nxd4 13. Qg7 Nxf3+ 14. Kf2 were unclear. Not even convincing 11... Nh5 12. Bxh7,False,"

The comment does not provide a clear explanation of the mistake; it only mentions intuition and unclear consequences without specifying the actual error in the player's move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on d4"
When problems are complex the right reply is not always found. Perhaps better was 12. Qxd4 although even in this case Black can keep some more possibilites in view of the endgame. For example: 12... Bc5 13. Qe5 Rxg2 14. Ne4 Bxe4 15. Bxe4 Ng4 16. Qh8+ Ke7 17. Qxd8+ Rxd8 18. Ne5 Bb4+ 19. Kf1 Rf2+ 20. Kg1 Re2 and the position and the pawns are an adequate compensation for the sacrificed material.,True,"

The comment properly analyzes the potential pitfalls and consequences of the move, indicating that it might not have been the best choice considering the counter-play available to Black, particularly in the endgame scenario.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on d4"
A serious mistake would have been 13... Ng4 for 14. Be4 Qh4+ 15.Kd1 Nf2+ 16. Kc2 and the attack vanishes.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake in the player's move by suggesting an alternative move 13... Ng4, which would have allowed Black to maintain pressure on the white king.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Rxg2 13. Qf1 Bc5,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5"
Again an inaccurate move which will cost material. 14. Nce2 was relatively better but after 14... Ng4 Black's attack would be irresistible.,True,"

The annotation correctly identifies the mistake in the move, acknowledging the initial inaccuracy and explaining the potential consequences of the opponent's subsequent attacking move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Rxg2 13. Qf1 Bc5 14. Nf3,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"
There was nothing better.,True,"

The comment suggests that the move was not strategically sound or advantageous, which implies a recognition of the mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Rxg2 13. Qf1 Bc5 14. Nf3 Rf2 15. Qxf2 Bxf2+ 16. Kxf2 Ng4+ 17. Kg3 Bxf3 18. Kxf3 Qh4 19. Be4,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e4"
White resigns.,False,"

The comment ""White resigns"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it indicates a decision to concede the game rather than the specific error in the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Qf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qg3 Bd6 8. f4 g5 9. Nf3 gxf4 10. exf4 Rg8 11. Qf2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Rxg2 13. Qf1 Bc5 14. Nf3 Rf2 15. Qxf2 Bxf2+ 16. Kxf2 Ng4+ 17. Kg3 Bxf3 18. Kxf3 Qh4 19. Be4 f5 20. Ke2 Qf2+ 21. Kd3 fxe4+ 22. Nxe4 Qf3+,"This is a game between Tjurn, I. (as White) and Mikenas, Vladas (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to f3 with check"
