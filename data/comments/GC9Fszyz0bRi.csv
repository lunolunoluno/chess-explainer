"With his 8th and 9th moves, White lays his cards on the table. He intends an immediate assault against the base c6. From what follows it appears that in this line Black's Queen excursion to h5 is not particularly good, for the Queen will soon find it necessary to return nearer to base",True," The comment suggests a potential weakness in Black's Queen’s move, indicating a tactical flaw.",1. d4 e6 2.

"We have now reached the formation studied with the e-pawn forward. On the basis of these examples given there we can make the following assertions: 1) Black has Kingside chances, but in view of White's defensive set-up (pawns on e3 and g3, Bg2), it may not be easy to make anything concrete out of them 2) White' Queenside attack is well advanced",True," The comment offers potential strategic observations, suggesting a flawed assessment of the position's possibilities.",1. d4 e6 2.

Another point in White's favour here. He does not have to wait for Black to attack with ... Pg5 but can himself take the initiative in this sector.
