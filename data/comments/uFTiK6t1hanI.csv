"Usually 7.Bd2 is played. With the move in the text Steinitz offers a pawn for the attack. Fonbarda does not dare to accept what could look like a gift. He knows very well that Steinitz does not make gifts. At most, he can can make a ""loan"". What he gives for loan, he wants back with extra charge. So, he decides to leave the known path and replies with 7...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic error in the move, pointing out that the player recognized Steinitz's intentions and chose to avoid the presumed ""gift"" of a pawn, opting instead for a more assertive move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"," In this context, Black (Von Bardeleben) is not taking the usual move 7.Bd2. Instead, they opt for a more unconventional response to White's (Steinitz) offer. This decision is strategic, as Black avoids what might seem like a baited opportunity, recognizing that White typically doesn't give away advantages freely. White's approach to any potential ""loan"" from Black would entail expecting a higher value in return. With this in mind, Black chooses a different tactical route."
"Questions: the isolated pawn in d4 is a strength or a weakness? Answer: it is a personal opinion, but I think it depends on who is sitting in front of you at the chessboard.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it is discussing the potential strength or weakness of an isolated pawn, rather than addressing the quality of the move played.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6",-
This move is preliminary to a series of exchanges. Favorable to whom? 10...,True,"

The comment appropriately highlights the nature of the mistake, indicating that the move could lead to exchanges that may not be beneficial for the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5", 'This move could lead to potential weaknesses. It's risky for Black (C. Von Bardeleben).'
"Can you see that Black would have had better castle at 9th move? Now Fonbarda must waste few tempi to castle ""artificially"". White also threatens 15.Re5. How to solve the problem? 14...",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the missed opportunity for Black to castle and suggesting that White's next move, 15.Re5, creates a problem that needs to be addressed.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1"," Comment: Black may have missed an opportunity to castle on move 9. White's move, Rook to e1, poses a threat that needs addressing. Black should consider castling quickly to safeguard the king with minimal time loss."
!! - An important square for the attack is worth a pawn. The square d4 is needed by the Knight.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that the player sacrificed a pawn to gain control of a crucial square (d4), which is necessary for the Knight's mobility and attacking potential.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"," White has played a pawn to d5, which is not ideal for advancing their knight to d4, as it does not contribute effectively to the center control or the attacking potential."
(threatening 20.Rc7 and evidencing the weakness of the pawn g7) 19...,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by highlighting the potential threat and the weakness created by the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18. Nd4 Kf7 19. Ne6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e6"," White's last move placed their knight on e6, which may not be the strongest positioning. It doesn't address the potential threat on c7 and doesn't improve the pawn structure on g7."
"!! Voila'! Take a picture, please! The Queen in g4 is under attack, the Knight in g5 in under attack, the Rook in c1 is under attack with a mate threat, the King in g1.... well, not him. Even the Rook in e7, the one that has kissed the enemy King, is under attack. 22...",True,"

The comment is an accurate explanation of the mistake, as it points out that the Queen, Knight, Rook, and King are all in positions to be attacked or threatened, indicating a poor defensive setup.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18.

Last move played: White plays Rook takes on e7 with check"," The move 22... was poor because it exposed their Rook to a checkmate threat, as White's Rook was aiming right at their Rook on e7. Additionally, the Black Knight in g5 is also threatened by White's Queen, putting pressure on the position."
"It is a pity, indeed, that is cannot be captured!",True,"

The comment suggests that the move was considered a mistake because the piece was easily captured by the opponent, indicating a blunder on the part of the player who made that move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18.

(as White) must consider the consequences of this move.

It's unfortunate that White's last move could lead to a disadvantageous position."
The Black Queen maliciously had slightly raised her skirt to show her nice ankles but Steinitz was 59 years old and he was not attracted by such thing as he used to be.,False,"

The comment is a humorous and unrelated remark, not providing any constructive analysis of the move's quality.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7.

Rf7+,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Von Bardeleben, C. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to f7 with check",-
!! - These are burning and humiliating shots! 24...,True,"

The comment accurately describes a blunder in the game, using strong language to indicate the severe impact of the move on the player's position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18. Nd4 Kf7 19.

"During these last moves the spectators disturbed the quietness of the hall with noisy applauses and that bothered Von Bardeleben, which, without replying at the 25th move and without stopping the clock, stood up and muttering something, left the hall and never came back. Was is Steinitz fault if the spectators behaved like that? No, of course. His only fault was that he, once again, proved himself to be a ... monster.",False,"

The comment focuses more on the behavior of the spectators and other players, rather than addressing the actual chess move made by the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Bxd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Re1 f6 15. Qe2 Qd7 16. Rac1 c6 17. d5 cxd5 18. Nd4 Kf7 19.
