"From what I've seen Morozevich prefers stable pawn structures and depends upon piece play. He might like a Benko Gambit or a Dutch Defense, but in this case he's trying to provoke Bareev into 2. e4, an opening system Bareev doesn't usually play. This position could easily transpose to many different things: Dutch Leningrad with ...f7-f5, Gruenfeld with c2-c4 ...d7-d5, King's Indian Defense with c2-c4 ...Ng8-f6 and others.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the unconventional opening played by Bareev which deviates from his preferred systems and could lead to various complex positions.",1. d4 g6,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"
"This is usually followed by c2-c4 to make a King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Variation or, after ...d7-d5, a Gruenfeld Defense.",False,"

The comment explains the strategic intent behind certain moves but does not directly address the mistake made by the player.",1. d4 g6 2. g3,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3"
"This forces the game off into another direction. It's thematic for Black to fight on the dark squares, but White's setup is a little unusual. If White plays d4-d5 Black might play ...b7-b5; something he wouldn't ordinarily be able to do.",False,"

The comment doesn't directly explain the mistake made by the player; it only suggests a potential future plan or idea for Black.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
"White chooses to support his central pawn and to block Bg7, but at the cost of not having c3 available for a knight. Incidentally, Pc5 is now threatened.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the player's choice to prioritize pawn support over the flexibility of having a c3 square for a knight, which subsequently leads to an attack on the c5 pawn.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c3"
"Black thre atens ...cxd4 to remove the central pawn. For White to simply defend it with Ng1-f3 is possible, but ...cxd4 cannot be replied to with c3xd4 (it's pinned) , so the central pawn is removed.",True,"

The comment accurately explains why the move...cxd4 is a mistake, as it creates a double pin on the d4-pawn for White's knight, making the move indefensible.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a5"
"White uses a small tactic to get rid of Qa5, so Pc3 can truly support Pd4.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it inaccurately describes the move. The move mentioned does not involve Qa5 and does not support Pd4.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"
Black's queen is chased off the a5-e1 diagonal!,True,"
The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, as the queen being removed from the a5-e1 diagonal indicates a significant loss of material or positional disadvantage.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b3"
"O.K. White has the central pawn, but Nb3 isn't terribly well placed. Black could go after it with ...a7-a5-a4.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by highlighting the weakness of the knight's position and suggesting a potential counterattack strategy for Black.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d4"
Black chooses not to make it an issue immediately and develops more pieces. That's quite good because it's a recognition Black doesn't have to chase Nb3 and wouldn't necessarily gain anything from chasing Nb3 anyway; that Black can simply play normal moves and the weakness of Nb3 will show itself.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that Black did not immediately capitalize on the weakness of the knight on b3 and chose to develop pieces instead, which allows the weakness to present itself naturally.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
"Audacious moves such as this aren't seen often. Black has traded his central pawn away and White shoves his to cramp Black, preventing ...d7-d5 or ...Nb8-c6. Black has to act forcefully to be rid of the influence of Pd5 or create some way to play around it.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic weakness caused by White's pawn move and the resulting difficulty for Black to counteract White's plan.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"
"Black is probably taking aim at Pd5 (though there is also ...Nb4 followed by ...Bc8-f5-c2) , but I think Black needs to ensure space on the queen-side for Qb6 and the knight by first playing ...a7-a5 and ...a5-a4 if possible.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the need for Black to maintain space on the queen's side for future development, which the move in question may have compromised.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a6"
essentially preventing ...Bc8-f5,True,"

The comment suggests that the player's move created a situation where the opponent's bishop could potentially move to f5, which may have been a strategic threat or a positional advantage that the opponent could exploit.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d4"
threatening Bd2-a5 to win Qb6,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a winning move that was not executed.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d2"
"It's odd to note this, but this is the same awkward place for the queen which occurred in the Leko-Bareev Caro-Kann game. Now Bareev is on the other side.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by highlighting an error in the player's positioning of the queen, which is reminiscent of a similar mistake in a specific game (Leko-Bareev Caro-Kann).",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a6"
White just keeps moving forward into the breech and Black can't easily challenge any of White'spieces!,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by identifying White's overextension and the difficulty for Black to counterattack effectively.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
"A lot of White's advantage is dissipated by the piece trades, but the essential character of the position remains. Qa6 is badly placed and the c-file is an open avenue.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by pointing out the loss of White's advantage and the poor positioning of the Black queen, as well as the open c-file, which indicates flaws in the move that the commentator is discussing.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on c1"
"and Black threatens to maneuver the knight via e5 toward the queen-side where he might play with an extra minor piece, while Bg2 is useless! There is also the possibility, intended or not, of ...Bh6 to deflect Qd2 away from the defense of Ba5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains Black's mistake by highlighting the potential threats and the ineffectiveness of the move Bg2.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to g4"
If White challenges the open file Black might play ...b7-b6 to open the a-file and capture Pa2. In that event it's likely both player's back ranks would become weak after a rook trade.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake by highlighting the potential consequences of White challenging the open file, which could lead to a weak back rank after a rook trade.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19. Nd3 Rc8,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c8"
"White tries to guard the weaknesses at b2 and c2, but it's clear now Black has more than equalized.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by White, as it recognizes that White's attempt to protect the weaknesses on the c-file was insufficient, allowing Black to gain an advantage.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19.

"Black seems to be retreating toward his king, though I don't know why.",True,"

The comment accurately points out that the player is making a move that could be seen as retreating towards the king, which may indicate a mistake as it can leave the king less protected.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to e5"
"Black removes Pd5, so White's bishop might return to g2, mightn't it?",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by acknowledging that the move Pd5 allows White's bishop to potentially recapture on g2, leading to a disadvantage for Black.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19.

Bf1 Qxd5,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on d5"
Black zeros in on the weak Pf2,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by highlighting the vulnerability of the pawn on f2, which the black player has capitalized on, potentially putting the white king or other pieces in danger.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19.

Kh2 Qd2,"This is a game between Bareev, Evgeny (as White) and Morozevich, Alexander (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d2"
"But, before the bishop can do any harm Black will be able to grab it.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that the bishop is at risk of being captured by Black's piece, indicating a potential loss of material.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6. Nb3 Qb6 7. cxd4 Nf6 8. d5 d6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O Na6 11. Nfd4 Bd7 12. Bd2 Nc5 13. Ba5 Qa6 14. Qd2 Rfc8 15. Nxc5 Rxc5 16. Nb3 Rc4 17. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 18. Nxc1 Ng4 19. Nd3 Rc8 20. h3 Ne5 21.

"It's difficult for Black to find a good plan, despite his material advantage, because White's pieces are active and threatening Pf7. Black's Rf8 isn't of any use for the offense.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that Black's move Rf8 is ineffective due to White's active pieces and the threat to Black's pawn on f7.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6.

"mate in 5. Notice that despite the fact all material is equal (except for bishop vs. knight) Black's forces are split into two groups which aren't working together, whereas White's forces are in one area and very much working toward one goal!",True,"

The comment accurately describes the structural weaknesses in Black's position, which ultimately lead to the checkmate.",1. d4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. c3 Qa5 5. Nd2 cxd4 6.
