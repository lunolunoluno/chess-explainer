Trying to improve on 9...Be7 with which I had scored 0/2. My opponent also favours the Najdorf.,True,"

#In reply to this I received an interesting letter which contained no moves; my hopes rose accordingly.,False,"

Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Nb3 Nbd7 9. Qf3 Qc7 10. Bd3 b5 11. O-O-O Bb7 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13.

Barnett repeated this move correctly but on his board he apparently moved my e P instead (his comments had revealed a preference for descriptive notation) so:,True,"
