"Wollner is admirably ""modern"" in his lack of greed, and insists on completing his development.",True," The comment suggests the playerâ€™s lack of greed is a positive quality, potentially indicating a strategic understanding.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"But now something curious happens -- Charousek's imagination goes into overdrive! The most natural move here would be the simple and obvious Bg5, pinning the Knight and threatening Nd5 to disrupt the Kingside pawn formation. Black, however, could meet the pin with Nbd7, since he has not committed his N/b8 to c6 yet. Charousek therefore tries something which might, in the final analysis, be labeled a ""coffeehouse"" move. But if so, then coffeehouse chess is superb!",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a creative, less conventional approach, which strengthens the argument against the move.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Well, what can the point of all of this be? The Knight is just hanging out there. We know that Nxf7 is, on general principles, a poor move -- trading two active minor pieces for a R + P is a bad deal in the opening and middlegame. Impatiently, Wollner tries to brush the Knight aside like Goliath trying to brush that pesky shepherd lad out of the way...",True," The comment provides specific reasoning for why the move is considered a mistake, offering a strategic critique of the Knight's placement.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Rules are made to be broken -- not often, but on just those occasions when genius rises to the occasion! Charousek has no intention of giving up his perfectly good Bishop for the Rook on f7. Instead, he has spied a fascinating feature of the position. We saw that by delaying the development of his Queen's Knight, Black has reserved the possibility of Nbd7 defending f6. But Charousek has seen -- and brilliantly exposes -- the dark side of Black's delayed development. The following combination is made possible because Black's Queen is undefended!",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting a strategic advantage achieved through a calculated delay in development.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

This pulls the Rook away from the eighth rank. Now the d-pawn is pinned against the undefended Queen.

"Only this move is a just followup to the Knight sacrifice. Black's N/f6 must move (or he has lost material for nothing), and White will push this pawn up to e6.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting Black's move is a logical continuation of the sacrifice, but lacks specific analysis of the resulting position.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Now the point of the sacrifice is becoming clearer. Charousek is not simply attacking the Rook: he has also used the P/e6 to cut off the defense of Black's Knight on the light diagonal from c8 to g4. In a sense, this is a very sophisticated double attack. Wollner is no fool: he realizes his position is desperate. So he immediately plays for the counterattack.",True," The comment provides a detailed explanation of why the move was considered a mistake, highlighting a complex double attack and the player's calculated response.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Wollner finally develops his Knight, lending his Rook's defensive aid to the beleaguered e8 square. But Charousek has realized something tremendous about this position. His Rook, sitting at f1, is on the same file as the enemy King. ""Yes,"" you say, ""but what of it? I often get my Rook on the same file as the enemy King -- but my own pawn blocks the file, so what's the use?"" Youth and genius do not lose heart for such trifles.

"One of the finest sacrificial conclusions on record. Not often does one get to sacrifice two Queens to force checkmate before move 20! Talk about efficient piece deployment!! It doesn't get better than this! Years later, Kester Svendsen wrote a wonderful short story entitled ""Last Round,"" about an old master who has tried for 50 years to create a work of art, the perfect game. In the crucial final round of a World Championship tournament, he trails the mighty Russian Rolavsky by half a point, and they are paired. Svendsen weaves his story around this as their game.
