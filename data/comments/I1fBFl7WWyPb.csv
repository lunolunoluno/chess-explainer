"I have just recently started using this almost exclusively, so that I can get a feel for it and ultimately broaden my repertoire. This was the strongest opponent I had since the switch (about 2350).",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on the player's recent experience with a new method and their opponent's strength level, rather than the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. d4,"This is a game between Thomas Hartwig,Th (as White) and John Meyer (as Black).

"Before the game I had made friendly conversation with my opponent and he mentioned a win in the Gruenfeld, so there was a psychological twist. Should I play 3.Nc3? And when I did, he would have to consider that I must not be afraid of the Gruenfeld,...",False,"

The comment provided does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it refers to a psychological factor rather than the specific move that was played.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3,"This is a game between Thomas Hartwig,Th (as White) and John Meyer (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3",-
"I have no idea if he plays both lines regularly or if these considerations actually came into play, since I had to leave immediately after the game.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it expresses uncertainty about the player's regularity of playing those lines and the considerations that may have influenced their move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

This is the first time I have had the white side of this position.,True,"

The comment indicates that the player may have overlooked a familiar or critical positional pattern, possibly leading to a suboptimal move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6.

"This seems like a good plan. First of all it prepares ...f5. The other point is that on Nd2 he can take it now. I realized this, but I was lured to play it anyway because I saw a pretty tactic that would be nice to get on the board!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player was lured by a tempting tactic that overshadowed the strategic disadvantage of leaving the position vulnerable.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 a5 10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. a4 Nd7 12. Ba3 Bh6,"This is a game between Thomas Hartwig,Th (as White) and John Meyer (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to h6"," ""This plan was not optimal. Firstly, preparing f5 is premature. Secondly, Black (John Meyer) could capture it immediately with Nd2. I noticed the potential but was enticed by a tempting tactical opportunity."""
This is the idea that enticed me to play 13.Nd2. There is a pretty tactic that allows me to take the initiative on the queenside.,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player because it highlights a potential strategy for gaining an advantage, rather than addressing the error or its consequences.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"Very interesting, but I passed up a big chance here. In fact I wanted to play 16.c5 very much as it seems like the thematic move, but I missed the critical follow-up 19.Qb2.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as they missed the critical follow-up move 19.Qb2 after playing 16.c5, which could have been a stronger thematic move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 a5 10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. a4 Nd7 12. Ba3 Bh6 13. Nd2 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 f5 15. Nb5 Ra8 16. f4,"This is a game between Thomas Hartwig,Th (as White) and John Meyer (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"," The decision not to play 16.c5 was a missed opportunity. The thematic move was appealing, but the critical follow-up of 19.Qb2 was overlooked."
Very calm. Black is apparently under a lot of pressure but he still wants to let me release the central tension. I think I justified his choice in the game.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to justify the move rather than analyze the error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7.

This is the big difference - it turns out that now black has more breathing space. Nonetheless I could have played better and maintained a completely healthy position.,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake, as it acknowledges that the move did not result in the best possible outcome for the player, but it also provides context by highlighting that the opponent now has more breathing space and maintains a healthy position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Not forced but not bad if I follow it up right.,True,"

The comment implies that the move was not necessarily a mistake, but rather a choice that could potentially lead to a positive outcome if responded to correctly.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"Because of my feeble play I am worse now. However, it isn't clear to me whether black is actually ever winning.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player as they acknowledge their poor play and uncertainty about black's position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7.

"This is correct, but not for the reasons I thought at the time. In fact 24...Kf8 is best met the same way as in the game whereas I had intended 25.c5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the error in the move but also clarifies the better alternative and the player's original intention.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 a5 10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. a4 Nd7 12. Ba3 Bh6 13. Nd2 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 f5 15. Nb5 Ra8 16. f4 b6 17. fxe5 Nxe5 18. Bb2 Bd7 19. Bxe5 dxe5 20.

"A ""sack"". However it is more or less the only winning try and hardly puts black in danger of losing.",True,". The comment acknowledges that the move was a mistake, but also highlights that it was a potential advantageous move, indicating an understanding of the strategic situation despite the error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Black was down to his last ten minutes and decides to repeat. Frankly I think the position was drawn anyway.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that repeating the position was a mistake, especially considering the time pressure, and implies that it was a strategic error despite the position being potentially drawn.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Agreed drawn.,True,"

The comment indicates that both players agree that the move resulted in a draw, which implies that the move was not advantageous to either player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5.
