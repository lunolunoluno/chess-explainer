"This is a mistake. This weakens black's king (the e8-h5 diagonal is now open), doesn't develop, and not black is unable to boot a white piece from e5. He will have to use pieces now to do that. Instead, simple development like ...Nf6 or ...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is to be recommended.",True," The comment identifies a critical positional weakness and suggests a better development plan, indicating a flawed move.",1. d4 d5 2.

"I understand your wish to post a knight on c5, but this move is dubious. By far, the e5 square is a better outpost. It is a hole in your opponent's position. A hole is a square that your opponent's pawns can't cover. c5, on the other hand, can easily be covered by the black b-pawn. Instead of Bg5, I recommend the following setup to take advantage of black's weakening by f5: Nc3, Bc4, Nf3, castles short (O-O), and Re1, with a definite advantage to white because b lack's e6 pawn is a target.",True," The comment provides specific reasoning for why the move is considered a mistake, highlighting a positional weakness in the opponent's position.",1. d4 d5 2.

"A good rule of thumb to follow is: don't attack until you've gotten all your knights & bishops out, and you've castled to safety! Your entire army wants to get involved in the fight. If you use just a few pieces, you can be overwhelmed if you opponent uses all of his pieces, kind of like a 3 on 1 fast break in basketball. Instead, Be2 looks best, so that if black tries to push ...e5, white won't have to worry about a discovered check, because the bishop would be blocking.

"This isn't good. Black is threatening ...Qxc5. White MUST prevent the loss of a piece. Qe2! does the job! Black can't take the knight since that would expose his king to check by the white queen on e2, which is illegal. White only loses a pawn this way. Also, the knight on e2 block's white's bishop from getting out. This will cause problems later.

"This still hangs a piece on c5. Nb3, followed by 11. Qd2 (trying to castle-queenside and thereby free white's e2 knight to move) is the best way to proceed. 10.
