"I don't recall ever seeing Polgar play 1. c4, so this ought to be interesting. When these two first met in tournaments Polgar won handily, then Shirov moved ahead and Polgar has been working hard to catch up. This tournament shows some of the results of that work.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only provides background information about the game history between Polgar and Shirov, and not the specific reason behind the incorrect move.",1. c4,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4",-
Though a popular set-up (nowadays) I usually avoid developing a piece where it will be blocked (as Bg7 is blocked by Pe5) .,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it points out the issue of developing the bishop to a square where it's blocked, which can potentially limit its mobility and activity on the board.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"," Black's last move, playing pawn to g6, can be considered suboptimal by White. It's common knowledge that moving a piece to a square where it gets blocked can be a poor choice, as seen here with the bishop's position being obstructed by the pawn at e5."
"Now it's just transposed to a King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Variation which is still considered good for White, though the players involved make the difference. In this case Shirov as Black should be up to the task.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the strategic implications of the move, suggesting it transposes the game into a well-known variation, and indicates the player's potential to handle the position.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," In this move, White has transposed into a King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Variation, which is generally strong. However, it is crucial for Black, Alexei, to execute the strategy effectively to capitalize on their position."
"defending Nc3 to prepare b2-b3, Bc1-b2 and clearing the d-file to align Rd1 with Qd8",False,"

The comment seems to suggest a strategy rather than pointing out a specific mistake made by the player.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2",-
Shirov changes the direction of the game and leaves Qd8 a bit cramped.,True,"
The comment accurately identifies the mistake by Shirov and explains the potential consequence of the move.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d4"," After Shirov's move, they've shifted the game's dynamics, leaving White's queen on d8 with limited mobility."
"Often h2-h3 is used to guard g4, but in this case Pf3 defends Pe4 and guards g4. Later on it might advance further and Pg3 won't have been weakened. It's hard to say at this point whether it's especially better.",True,"

The comment correctly analyzes the mistake by explaining the potential issues with the move and discussing its possible future implications.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10. Nxd4 a5 11. e4 Nc5 12. f3,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"," After Polgar's last move, White's decision to play Pawn to f3 didn't align with common strategies. Typically, a move like h2-h3 aims to protect the g4 square, but in this position, the Pawn to f3 move effectively covers the e4 square. The plan here might involve further pawn advances, which suggests that even if a future Pawn to g3 move occurs, it won't weaken White's position. It's uncertain whether this move is significantly better at this juncture."
Finally Shirov activates his queen at the cost of weakening Pd6. A lot of games have been won with the Black pieces from this opening and many have been tense dramatic struggles.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that Shirov made a mistake by weakening his pawn structure with Pd6, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities in his position.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10. Nxd4 a5 11. e4 Nc5 12. f3 c6,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c6"," Shirov's decision to move their queen to d6 weakens their pawn on c6, a position that's commonly associated with strategic wins in this opening for Black. This move might not always lead to dramatic outcomes, but it's a critical error considering the usual advantages of Black at this juncture in the game."
It's easier to retreat off the e-file than to defend Be3.,True,"
The comment implies that retreating off the e-file would have been a better strategic move than defending Be3 in the given situation.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10. Nxd4 a5 11. e4 Nc5 12. f3 c6 13. Be3 Qe7 14. Bf2,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Shirov, Alexei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f2", The retreat to f2 weakens the king's defenses more than protecting the e5 square.
"White's pawns are pretty safe, but her pieces will have to be activated and brought into the battle in a more aggressive way, as the game progresses, if she's to win.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the player's pieces are not currently active or aggressive enough in the game, which could lead to potential mistakes if they don't adjust their strategy.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10. Nxd4 a5 11. e4 Nc5 12. f3 c6 13. Be3 Qe7 14.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to e5"," Black's last move with the Knight to e5 is a bit passive and doesn't contribute much aggression to the position. Black's pieces need to be actively engaged and brought into the fray as the game unfolds, otherwise, White might capture their pieces and gain an advantage."
White creeps forward...,False,"

The comment does not provide enough information to assess the quality of the move, as it only states that the player advanced their piece without specifying which piece, the destination square, or why it was considered a mistake.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3.

"At this point it's hard to say what White's plan is, besides keeping Shirov restrained and cramped. The open a-file might be of some use, but the center might become active again in a moment, so it seems to be only a slight advantage to White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the limited strategic advantage and potential risks of the move, indicating it was evaluated as a mistake.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3.

aligning with Qc7 and possibly preparing Nc3-d5,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10.

"After this it looks like Ne2 might go to c3 while Na4 then becomes the awkward piece which might go to b6, c5 (if Pd6 moves) or b2.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies a potential mistake and offers alternatives for the player's subsequent moves, which can help the player improve their strategy.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4.

The Na4 could potentially move to b6, c5 (if Black plays Pd6), or to b2, positions that could weaken White's control over the board."
Qb3 was undefended and she wanted to avoid complications stemming from ...b7-b5.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as the move Qb3 leaves the queen undefended, and the player likely wanted to avoid the potential complications from the opponent's b7-b5 pawn advance.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 exd4 10. Nxd4 a5 11. e4 Nc5 12. f3 c6 13. Be3 Qe7 14. Bf2 Nfd7 15. b3 Ne5 16. h3 Ned7 17. Rd2 Bh6 18. Re2 f6 19. f4 Nf8 20.

This could be to free Bg2 or to threaten h4-h5xg6 to create an attack on the h-file. At this point it might seem to White that trading pieces (such as Rc1-a1) is risky because there are several weak pawns which need defenders.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the potential strategic consequences of the move, highlighting both the intent behind it and the possible risks involved such as the creation of weaknesses in the pawn structure.",1. c4 e5 2. g3 g6 3.

She chose a good moment for this advance; after Black had moved toward the queen-side and weakened his control of e5. It might have also been a 40-move time control.,False,"
