"Already a bit of a surprise from X3D Fritz. Computers almost always play 1.e4 against humans because it leads to open positions with sharper, more concrete play, at least speaking very broadly. Of course any chess opening can lead to a sharp position, as we see here. The X3D Fritz team had a specific opening line in mind when they went for 1.d4 in this critical game four.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic focus of the computer's opening choice.",1. d4,"This is a game between X3D Fritz (as White) and Kasparov, Garry (as Black).

"The Queen's Gambit Accepted, as Black accepts the offer of the pawn. Unlike other gambits Black only rarely attempts to hold on to his extra pawn in this variant.

Kasparov heads into a line he has played before. You can see why the X3D Fritz team liked this line. All the pieces are still on the board and there are open lines for attack and piece play. There are no lines of blocked pawns to inhibit the computer's calculating ability. The downside is unrelated to the objective characteristics of the position. It's that Kasparov knows this position very well and is likely to have studied it deeply. This turns out to have been exactly the case.,True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting the player's familiarity with the position is a key factor.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3.

"Now White has what we call an isolated queen's pawn, a very common structure. The pawn on d4 has no pawns alongside it to defend it and it can be a target for Black's forces. In compensation White has excellent open lines for developing his pieces and the pawn controls important center squares. It is also possible to advance the pawn to start an attack.",True," The comment offers a description of a specific tactical situation, suggesting a flaw in the player's assessment of the resulting position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3.

"This move made it clear to Kasparov that the X3D Fritz team was headed into a line that was played in several very high-profile games a few years ago. Kasparov played in two of them, one with white in 1999 and one with Black in 2001! That 2001 game was against no lesser an opponent than world #2 Vladimir Kramnik on the stage in Moscow. Kasparov had won that game and no one had dared to play that line for White since then. Kasparov now started to play slower, warily looking ahead for what X3D Fritz had in mind. More precisely, what the X3D opening book team had in mind. The machine was still playing out of its opening library, not thinking on its own at all. There is a dead giveaway by the way the machine plays its moves instantaneously when it is still in its database book. When that's going on Kasparov knows that he is still following the programmers' preparation.",True," The comment provides a strong contextual explanation of why the move was considered a mistake, highlighting a potential strategic blunder and referencing a significant historical event.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3.

"After this Kasparov went into a very long think. He had faced this exact position two years ago in Moscow against his arch-rival, world #2 Kramnik. They were playing a match of blitz, games with just five minutes per player instead of the two hours plus of classical chess. Kasparov's was wondering if he should continue to follow the line from that game. He beat Kramnikspectacula rly in that 2001 blitz game by sacrificing his queen and winning a wild tactical melee. But surely trying that against X3D Fritz would be close to suicide. It was just that sort of position the computer team dreamed of when they told X3D Fritz to play this line if given the chance. So Kasparov sat there for a while looking at the alternatives. He was mentally thumbing through his years of memorized analysis and looking to see what dangerous improvements the X3D Fritz team might have found.",True," The comment provides context about the strategic considerations Kasparov was grappling with, suggesting the move was a flawed choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3.

"Kasparov avo ids the wild queen sacrifice line and recaptures with the pawn. Grandmaster Yasser Seirawan, one of the ESPN commentators, didn't like this line at all against a computer because of the many open lines.

Kasparov was relieved when the computer actually thought for a while before playing this obvious move. That meant it was finally out of its opening library and he wasn't out of his!

"Making things easier for Kasparov. The world #1 had already seen through to the completely equal endgame that is now coming. X3D Fritz could have kept more material on the board instead of exchanging, but it doesn't know how to do anything other than play the best move. If a move that simplifies is rated as 0.01 points better than an incredibly complicated move it will play the simplifying move even though it would have much better winning chances against a human by playing the complicating move. One thing the X3D Fritz team might not have been aware of is that the previous game to reach this position was played by GM Andrei Kharlov, a Russian who has been part of Kasparov's analysis team several times.
