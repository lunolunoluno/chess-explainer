One of the most solid systems in the very solid by nature Nimzo Indian Defence. It has been played many times in World Chess Championship matches - it's a sign of quality by itself.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it praises the Nimzo Indian Defence without addressing the specific move that was played incorrectly.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3,"This is a game between Kramnik, Vladimir (as White) and Ivanchuk, Vassily (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3"
Vassily tries to find something less well known. According to my database this move was played for the first time in 1983 by Hungarian GM A. Adorjan. Black wants to exchange his b and c-pawns for White's c and d-pawns and gain a pawn majority in the center. Of couse Black loses out on development after that.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the risky pawn exchange and the resulting loss of development that led to the poor move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5,"This is a game between Kramnik, Vladimir (as White) and Ivanchuk, Vassily (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
Vladimir plays in a classical manner - he simply develops his pieces and will try to use his extra-tempos.,False,"

The comment does not directly refer to the mistake made by the player as it simply describes his usual playing style and strategy.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7.

Very interesting pawn sacrifice.,True,"

The comment indicates that the move was likely a pawn sacrifice, which suggests it was a mistake as pawn sacrifices are typically made to gain a positional advantage rather than being a common mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13.

"Ivanchuk decided to reject this ""gift"". In case of",True,"

The comment implies that the player made a poor decision, likely giving up a valuable piece or position, which is commonly referred to as a ""gift"" in chess.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13.

"As Zigbert rasch said: ""One piece placed bad - all game is bad!"". The b7 Knight isn't only bad by itself, it also stops the c6 Bishop retreating. As a result Black will have a weak pawn on the c-file.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the strategic mistake in placing the Knight on b7, which not only disrupts the Bishop's mobility but also weakens the c-file pawn structure.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Rc1 Nb7 14. e4 O-O 15.

"Vladimir doesn't hurry. Black hasn't any real counterplay. If Black plays e6-e5 (to restrict the g2 Bishop), than White will play h3-h4 and Bh3, and Black will have problems with protecting the c6-pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential problems Black would face after playing e6-e5, and the consequences of White's likely response.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

At the best moment! Now the d7 knight can't go to d5 via f6 or b6.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, stating the consequences of the move on the knight's mobility.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7.

"White is free of prejuduce. The ""Bad"" knight can take the d4-square so it has to be exchanged.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake, as the knight is indeed in a position to take the d4-square and should be exchanged.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7.

When Kramnik has a passed pawn he is twice as dangerous as usual! Another very important point (apart from the passed pawn.) - in this open position the Bishop is stronger than the Knight.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses general principles rather than the specific move in question.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Rc1 Nb7 14. e4 O-O 15. Nd4 Rc8 16. Nxc6 dxc6 17. Qe2 Qc7 18. Rc2 Rfd8 19.

Very precise play. Now the Black King has to go away from the passed pawn.,True,"

This comment explains the mistake as it highlights the consequence of the move, forcing the Black King to move away from the passed pawn, which could potentially lead to a disadvantageous position for Black.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Rc1 Nb7 14. e4 O-O 15. Nd4 Rc8 16. Nxc6 dxc6 17. Qe2 Qc7 18. Rc2 Rfd8 19.

Rd8+,"This is a game between Kramnik, Vladimir (as White) and Ivanchuk, Vassily (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to d8 with check"
First of all White has to activate his King. Too early was,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake by pointing out that White needs to activate their King, and that doing so too early in the game is incorrect.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Rc1 Nb7 14. e4 O-O 15. Nd4 Rc8 16. Nxc6 dxc6 17. Qe2 Qc7 18. Rc2 Rfd8 19.

Kf2,"This is a game between Kramnik, Vladimir (as White) and Ivanchuk, Vassily (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to f2"
To cut the King off from the passed pawn. Much worse was,False,"

The comment does not fully explain the mistake made by the player because it does not provide specific information about the move itself or the consequences of it.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 b5 6. cxb5 Bxb5 7. Bg2 c5 8. O-O Bc6 9. Ba3 Na6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Rc1 Nb7 14. e4 O-O 15. Nd4 Rc8 16. Nxc6 dxc6 17. Qe2 Qc7 18. Rc2 Rfd8 19.

Now Black has only pawn moves but they will run out soon.,True,"

The comment correctly points out that limiting oneself to only pawn moves can lead to a strategic disadvantage as it restricts mobility and potential for future development.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

It's a zugzvang.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the move as a blunder, as a ""zugzwang"" occurs when a player is put at a disadvantage because they must make a move when they would prefer to pass and not move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
