1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6,He seems to have absorbed the Kasparov-Kramnik games with this opening and feels it's safe enough in this event. He's probably not more ambitious than to hope for a draw in his games with the Black pieces.,False

Ng5 Ke8,"Black has achieved much of his plan to develop Bc8-g4 and clear the way for Ra8-d8. But, this does nothing for Bf8 and Rh8 AND Bg4 is a little vulnerable to White's king-side pawns. White has to find a way to keep Pc2 safe (as usual) as he chases Bg4 back -- bringing more pawns to the aid of Pe5, so White can force another line opening before Black can get Bf8 & Rh8 developed.",True

Nxf7 Kxf7 19. Rxd7+ Ke6 20. Rxc7 Nd3 21. Bd4 Rxh3,Though Pb7 is en prise it appears Black's pieces are all active enough and White's seem uncoordinated. That might change in a few moves though; the position is quite fluid.,False
