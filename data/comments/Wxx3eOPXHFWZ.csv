"Castling on either wing is taboo, but the King is perfectly safe in the centre. The only problem Judit had was where to best develop the rooks: c8 was the most obvious for the queen's rook, and from g8, the king's rook stays out of harms way after the h-file is opened.",True," The comment identifies a specific tactical flaw and suggests a better development plan, indicating a misunderstanding of the moveâ€™s implications.",1. e4 c5 2.

However, it does seem well out of place on a7.",True," The comment suggests a strategic misjudgment by Kasparov, highlighting a potential mismatch in plans.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.
