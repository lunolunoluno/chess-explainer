The Kasparov Variation.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely refers to a specific variation named after Garry Kasparov without providing any context or details about the move that was deemed a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Castling on either wing is taboo, but the King is perfectly safe in the centre. The only problem Judit had was where to best develop the rooks: c8 was the most obvious for the queen's rook, and from g8, the king's rook stays out of harms way after the h-file is opened.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain a mistake made by the player, but rather gives strategic advice on rook placement and king safety.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.

"Entombing Kasparov's queen. Kasparov's novelty of 20 Qxd4 had the idea of Qa7 in mind - trying to stretch the Black defenses - so he must have known that his queen was safe here. However, it does seem well out of place on a7.",False,"

The comment does not explicitly explain the mistake made by the player; it provides speculation on the player's intentions rather than addressing the specific error in the move.",1. e4 c5 2.
