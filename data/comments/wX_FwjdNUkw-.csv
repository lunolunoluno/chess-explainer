"Actually, I have an extra tempo by comparison with most Queen's Gambit positions. We have left the world of the Nimzoindian for good, and the excursion of the bishop from f8 to b4 and back to e7 is just a waste of time.",True, The comment expresses a concern about the move's impact on the strategic possibilities and suggests a missed opportunity.,1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

A good move. Karpov eases the pressure on his position by preparing to trade bishops. He also creates a nice square at e7 for the knight.

"I am dangling the b-pawn as bait. Karpov is much too good a player to fall for the trap, but perhaps the distraction caused him to create a situation on the h3-c8 diagonal he would quickly come to regret.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic miscalculation.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
