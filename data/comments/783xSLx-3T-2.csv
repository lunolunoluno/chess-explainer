"White has grabbed a lot of space, but given Black a target in the process. Black last move sharpens things up a lot. Since White can't play 6.exf5 Bxg2 7.Qh5+ Kf8, he has to leave e4 as a target.",True," The comment identifies a potential weakness in White's strategy and suggests a counter-attack, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. c4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3.

"No more queen. If White had left the knight alone he'd just be out a pawn. Now he could resign, but in an Interzonal one doesn't give up easily.",True," The comment suggests a missed opportunity and a potential loss, indicating a flawed strategic decision.",1. c4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3.
