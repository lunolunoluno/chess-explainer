"Qd1 Rfd8 Passing on the creation of the isolated d-pawn (/\cxd4) is good here. It shows mature thought, even if it was not intentional. We all learn to automatically filter some things by instinct. This is a time saver but must be deliberately challenged. In this filtering process we develop bias such as (+)labels.[+] (e.g. ethnic and religious affiliations) These tend to put blinders on us. In chess, the basic teacher develops a set of rules and presents them in lessons. This system of indoctrinating the student is good because they must be understood since violating them means terrible consequences. Having come to understand the basic filters and biases we then learn to develop (+)exceptions[+] and deeper understandings. It is the difference between following the Law and living by the Spirit. One such 'law' in chess is that the isolated pawn is a (+)bad[+] thing. Typically, if you know how to handle the position, the isolated pawn can be difficult from either perspective. The fact that you either intentionally passed on this idea or unintentionally filtered the idea shows good potential. If it was an unintentional filter then you must focus energy on questioning these filters.",True," The comment offers insights into the potential negative consequences of automatic filtering and bias, which could be a contributing factor to the mistake.",1.

Lack of judgment. There is a time to become materialistic. Material is one of the most permanent and decisive imbalances. Taking the pawn with /\Nxa2 should have given you the game.

"Nd5 This is your (+)losing move.[+] There is a fine line between a (+)great[+] player and a (+)good[+] player. Several distinguishing characteristics are important to note at this point.

A (+)great[+] player also has the sense of when the position is critical. This is such a moment. Normally, I'd rail on this move but you had the courage to send in the game and learn something useful. Getting back to the idea of material, I like taking at a2. An interesting idea is /\Bd3.

"Nd7 Na5 Rec8 Coach's advice: For courage in allowing me to examine a lost game A+! This shows a desire to actually correct faulty thinking processes. (If only I could have your thoughts as you were thinking them/\..) So some ideas/\/\ Challenge your filters. You seem to be unwilling to grab the pawn when it was available but unwilling to give up the pawn for a greater good (winning the Queen). Start paying attention to these filters and force yourself to look beyond these (+)laws[+] you have learned. The truth is on the board, not on a set of learned rules. You show good positional judgment but do not seem to have good attacking skills. The problem with good positional judgment is that if you focus here, it is not enough to win! Somewhere you must attack, even if it is (+)pawn picking.[+] I'd suggest that you develop a (+)catalogue of positions. [+] To do this get some cards or a notebook where you will record positions for games you play or see. Somewhere keep a (+)key[+] on the correct moves by category. Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe topics would include (+) sacrifice[+], (+)pawns[+], (+)king safety.[+] Don't buy a book! You must do the work yourself, if a position strikes you enough for you to take the time to record it then you are more likely to learn it for yourself. I see that you are a (+)club[+] player. Clubs are fun and often good chess but/\.. The tendency is to play (+)cat and mouse[+] games with the other players minds. I'd suggest that you settle into three systems (two with Black and one with White) and play them regardless of who you play and what your opponent played last time. Here is the trick. You opponents will prepare for you, since you will be predictable, and will find the most difficult lines for you. That is good, they will test you and force you to grow and develop good lines. It will also force you to be precise in your opening moves. The idea is that you will have three openings that you know as well as anyone in the world and can play in any circumstance.
