"Black prepares ...Nc5 by for the moment preventing b2-b4. White, in turn, is ready to evict the knight from c5 by Ne1-d3, or to exchange it. Of course, I could have exchanged on d4 earlier, but when the white bishop is developed at e2 I do not like to take on d4.",True, The comment clearly indicates a strategic error – the exchange of the knight on c5 was a suboptimal choice due to the bishop's development.,1.

"It used to be thought that, when Black's knight reached c5, he achieved a good position. After all, I was not the first and not the tenth person to play the King's Indian. It was employed by Capablanca and the English Champion Yates, and it was played by Reti, Euwe, Chigorin and even Tarrasch. But it should be realised that this is a good position only compared with the Queen's Gambit, where you are down on your knees, awaiting the invasion of a knight at e5, the doubling of rooks, and so on.",True," The comment highlights a misinterpretation of the knight's position and suggests it’s only valuable compared to a different opening, indicating a flawed understanding of the move’s potential.",1.

"Georgy Lisitsyn was a very strong player, who wrote three excellent books - on the opening, middlegame, and endgame.

"A brilliant decision by White - he captured with his bishop (!) on c5 and then played f2-f4. I found myself in a very difficult position, and did not know what to do. In general, at that time I was not afraid of ending up in difficulties, as I always believed I would find something! That was also the case in the present game.",True," The comment describes a strategic error and the player’s confidence, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1.
