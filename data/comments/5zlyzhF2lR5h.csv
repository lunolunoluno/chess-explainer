According to Flohr the following continuation is stronger: 7... c5 8. Rd1 Qa5 9. Bd3 h6 10. Bh4 cxd4 11.exd4dxc4,True,"

The comment provided by Flohr does explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests a stronger continuation after 7... c5, implying that the player's move was suboptimal.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c6"," After Flohr's assessment, White's move 8. Rd1 could be considered inferior. Black's counter by playing 7... c5 and 8... Qa5 is a strong response, aiming to control the center and prepare for d5 push. White's subsequent moves, 9. Bd3, 10. Bh4, and 11. exd4cxd4, fail to challenge Black's setup effectively."
not 11... e5 because of 12. Bxd5 cxd5 13. Nc3,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it shows a tactical sequence where the player responded to their opponent's move 11... e5 with 12. Bxd5 cxd5 13. Nc3, which could lead to a potential advantage for the player.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"," Flohr, playing as White, might have considered the move 11... e5 as inadequate because it allows Black to recapture with 12. Bxd5 cxd5, followed by White's 13. Nc3, which can lead to a better position."
Vanek does not play 13...Nf6 in order to keep control over the e5 square,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by identifying the loss of control over the critical e5 square due to the move 13...Nf6.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"," Vanek made a poor move by not playing Nf6, which would have helped them control the e5 square."
"Better than 17.Rxd4, after which White would have lost control of the squares e4 and c5, and Black would have had a pawn majority on the queenside",True,"
The comment accurately explains why the move 17.Rxd4 was a mistake, as it would have allowed Black to gain control of critical squares and create a pawn majority on the queenside.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d4"," Moving the rook to d4 is not advisable as it would weaken White's position, particularly in terms of control over e4 and c5. Additionally, this move could allow Black to establish a stronger pawn presence on their queenside."
Flohr is b etter developed but has to act energically before Black Rooks come in action and attack together his isolated Pawn.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the need for better piece development and emphasizes the threat posed by the black rooks working together.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19. Re3,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e3"," Flohr's rook is better developed, but they must stay proactive to defend against Black's rooks working together and threatening their isolated pawn."
It was more convenient to go backward to e7. Now the Black Queen has to dance in a restricted field.,False,"

The comment doesn't fully justify the move as it focuses on the position of the Black Queen rather than explaining the strategic or tactical reasons behind the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19. Re3 Rad8 20.

22... f5 23. g4 Qxh4 (23... fxg4 24. Bh7+) 24. gxf5 etc.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake, as the move 23. g4 allows the queen to capture the pawn on h4, which is a significant blunder.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19. Re3 Rad8 20. Rf3 Qh4 21. g3 Qh5 22. h4 Bg4,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g4", '22... f5 23. g4 Qxh4 (Black's move weakens their position and allows White's bishop to attack with 24. Bh7+) 24. gxf5'
"Of course not 23... Bxf3 for 24. Bxf3 and the Queen's dance is over After 23.. . Rxd4 White could play 24. Bh7+ Kh8 25. Nxf7+ A relatively bettercontinuation would have been 23... Be6 24. Bh7+ Kh8 25. Bg6 fxg6 26. Nxg6+ Kg8 27. Rxf8+ Rxf8 28. Rxe6 and White is ""only"" a pawn up Not advisable 28. Nxf8 for 28... Bf5 29. Qc5 Qf7 30. Re5 Bc8 and now it is the Knight who has to stop his ride in the opponent field.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as retreating the bishop to f3 allows the opponent's rook to capture on d4, leading to a favorable continuation for the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19. Re3 Rad8 20. Rf3 Qh4 21. g3 Qh5 22. h4 Bg4 23. Re1 Nd5,"This is a game between Flohr, Salo (as White) and Vanek, Karel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d5"," In this move, Black played 23... Bxf3, which White exploited with 24. Bxf3. The resulting exchange of bishops doesn't offer White a significant advantage. A better alternative for Black could have been 23... Be6, aiming to solidify the defense. After 24. Bh7+ and 25. Nxf7+, Black's position is vulnerable, but White's immediate threats are not particularly advantageous. Instead of continuing with 25. Bg6, White should have played 25. Nxf8 to attack the Black King directly and threaten material gain. The sequence 28... Bf5 29. Qc5 Qf7 30. Rxe5 leads to a position where White has a slight edge due to the better activity of their pieces. It's crucial for Black to address the Knight's aggressive posture in their territory."
Surprise!,True,"
The comment ""Surprise!"" indicates that the player's move was unexpected, suggesting it was a mistake because it didn't follow the usual strategies or considerations in chess.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19.

Better than 26. Ng6+ Qxg6 27. Bxg6 Rf6 and Black still has sufficient forces to organize a solid defense.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not specify why the move was a mistake but rather analyzes a different sequence of moves.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19. Re3 Rad8 20.

Nearly forced.,False,"

The comment ""Nearly forced"" does not accurately describe the mistake made by the player, as it implies a decision with limited options, while a mistake typically indicates a lack of foresight or poor decision-making.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

And now? Who can stop this Pawn?,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a poor move, leaving their pawn vulnerable for an aggressive counterattack.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7.

"A mistake but Vanek was in zeitnot... Time is a sharp weapon, which both the players have. If one of them loses the possibility to use it ... that's bad for him! However Black's position was already compromised.",True,"
The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic aspect of time pressure in chess and acknowledging the compromised position of Black, which could have influenced the decision that led to the mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nd5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Ne4 N5f6 12. Bd3 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 h6 14. O-O e5 15. Rfe1 Qf6 16. Rad1 exd4 17. exd4 Nb6 18. Ne5 Be6 19.

The position was already vulnerable, and that move likely accelerated their disadvantage. It's crucial for both sides to manage time effectively in chess.'"
Enough!,False,"

The comment ""Enough!"" does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player; it seems more like an emotional reaction rather than a thoughtful analysis of the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.
