"Here Gunsberg picked up his KN with the clear intention of moving it to h4. He even placed it momentarily on that square, and then hastily retracted the move. After a while Gunsberg picked up the Knight again and played Nh4. As he did so he shook his head and shrugged his shoulders as if to say ""I'm bound to move this piece and I can't find any better place to put it""",True," The comment provides a detailed analysis of a player's thought process, revealing a potential hesitation and a lack of a clear strategic plan, suggesting a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Steinitz played this move without pausing to think.

"The instince to win material can manifest itslef in some strange ways. We must make it clear, howevver, that Gunsberg's tactics here are not to be condoned. After the game Steinitz pointed out that Gunsberg had himself been the victim of similar tactics, in a match game with Chigorin, and that on that occasion Gunsberg had been extremely angry",True," The comment suggests a potential flaw in the player's thinking, highlighting a potentially problematic tactical approach.",1. e4 e5 2.
