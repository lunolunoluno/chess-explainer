"This is a curious move. It threatens Pe5 which forces White, at least for the moment, to leave Nf3, which blocks Pf2 from advancing. Also, it prevents Bc1-f4 and clears the way for Bf8 to develop. I suppose Black decides how to develop his king-side pieces depending upon where White develops Bc1. If b2-b3, Bc1-b2 then Bf8 probably has to remain in place for a while to defend Pg7.",True," The comment provides a detailed analysis of the consequences of the move, suggesting a strategic thought process and potential responses for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

White has achieved a lot. To get this far is significant.

"After this (good move) Black begins to envisage ...Nd4xb3; axb3 a3-a2; and ...Bb7-a6-d3-b1 to allow a2-a1=Q or if White has placed Rd1-a1 to trap it, so Ra8 can be unopposed. This plan is merely an idea at this point, and hardly enforcable, but something to work toward.
