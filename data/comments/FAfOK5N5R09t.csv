"Veselin plays a slightly unusual defence. This is known as the Pirc, after a Yugoslav grandmaster who invented the concept. The idea is to allow White to set up a big pawn centre, and then to attack it with the Black pieces, particularly developing the bishop on the long black diagonal. Veselin probably thought it wise to avoid Garry's analysis in the more common Sicilian Defence variations.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic choice based on analysis and a specific opening.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

"OK, we are reaching crisis point. Black has mobilised his pawns and is about to push Garry backwards. Actually, Black has a fine position - all his pieces are bearing down on the centre - his only problem is that his king's position is a little bit airy.

"A second rook sacrifices itself!
