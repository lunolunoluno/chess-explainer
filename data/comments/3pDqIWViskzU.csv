"So much for theory, as far as my limited resources go. Though our wise database checkers may be able to point out precedents..",True,"

The comment suggests that the player is acknowledging a mistake and is considering using external resources, such as a database of chess games, to analyze the move and identify any relevant precedents.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4"," ""Their last move to Bishop f4 lacks strategic depth, but our database checkers could find similar situations for reference."""
"I'm not sure whether this is the right time for Black to play this, limiting the c8 Bishop.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it suggests that the move restricts the mobility of the Black bishop, which may not be the most effective use of time in the game.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6", They might be restricting their c8 Bishop too soon.
A less quiet possibility here would be 9 ... c5 or 9 ... dxc4 followed by c5,True,"

The comment provides a correct analysis by suggesting alternative moves that could have been made instead of the play in question, indicating that the player's current move was indeed a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b6", Black's move to b6 was not optimal. They could consider 9... c5 to challenge White's center or 9... dxc4 with a subsequent c5 to open up lines and gain space.
"I had decided Black would not want 10 ... Qxd5 11 Bxc7 but after 11 . .. Qc6 he does OK. My main intention was to have a position with d5 blocked, thus making a queen side fianchetto unattractive.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it details their strategic intent to block the d5 square, making a queen side fianchetto less appealing.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5"," Salter, D., as White, made a move that didn't align with the original strategy. The intended outcome was to obstruct the queen's ability to utilize the d5 square, making a fianchetto on the queen side less appealing. After Fereira, A., played...Qc6, the d5 square was indeed blocked, which was a part of the plan."
"Black goes for the pawn capture anyway. After all, the c8 h3 diagonal is available again.",True,"

The comment appropriately explains the mistake by pointing out that the pawn capture was not the best move available as the c8 h3 diagonal became open again.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d5"," Black makes the pawn capture on d5, overlooking better options due to the reopening of the c8 h3 diagonal."
The Bishop is driven back but it may still be a sacrificial force to be reckoned with if there is a build up against h3.,True,"

The comment acknowledges the consequence of the move but also highlights the potential strategic aim behind it, suggesting that the move, while seemingly a mistake, may have been part of a larger plan.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6"," Black's bishop retreated, which might still pose a threat if they build pressure against White's pawn on h3."
"A probing move, eyeing c6.",True,"

The comment justifies the evaluation as the move could indicate a tactical intention to target the weak square c6.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e5", White's knight advance to e5 is a speculative move with little tactical justification.
A response that looks weakening,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move made by the player weakens their position, suggesting it was a mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f6"," Salter, D. (White) played a move that appears to be weakening Black's position on the board."
An aggressive use of pawns in front of the King to keep me from achieving results on the h6 square. It is surprising how well Black does with this.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake because it highlights the player's aggressive yet unsuccessful pawn strategy, which limited their ability to progress on the h6 square, and acknowledges Black's effective use of the same tactic.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"," In this situation, White's advance with the pawn to g5 is aggressively blocking my access to the h6 square. It's remarkable how effectively Black handles this."
This was prompted by the attractive opening of the d1 h5 diagonal in an attempt to combine Bishop and Queen against h7.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as playing the h5 pawn can be a risky move, especially if the player's opponent can exploit the weak squares around the player's king.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to h2"," 'This move was a mistake. White's Knight went to h2, weakening their control over the h-file and exposing their King to potential threats.'"
Bringing more defensive forces into the arena.,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a defensive move, which was a mistake because it did not advance their position or control more space on the board.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e7", 'Black's move to bring a knight to e7 is not aggressive.'
The Qh5 line just does not seem to break through. Black has enough defenders to ward off the threats.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the player's overlooking Black's ability to counter the aggressive Qh5 move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2", The Qh5 move isn't strong enough to penetrate Black's defenses.
"Another pawn in front of the king! No battening down of hatches here. I decided to respond with a pawn thrust of my own, to give my g3 Bishop somewhere to retreat and to break things up a bit.",True,"

The comment indicates the player made a mistake by moving a pawn in front of their king, which is a critical mistake in chess, and the commenter's counteraction of advancing their own pawn is a response to this error.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5"," White decided to play a pawn to h5, lacking any strategic depth and failing to solidify their position."
Now Black is building threats himself. A well timed sac on h3 with advanced pawns to follow.,True,"
The comment correctly identifies the mistake by indicating that the player missed an opportunity to create threats and suggests a strategic countermove.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19. Be1 Qd7,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7", 'Now Black has initiated their own threats. A well-timed pawn sacrifice on h3 could lead to potential weaknesses.'
A bit of attack and defence. The Queen covers g4 and h5.,True,"

The comment explains that the move provided some attack and defense by having the Queen cover squares g4 and h5, which could indicate that it was a strategic attempt to protect certain key areas on the board.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19.

The Queen's position limits the potential for an aggressive push to g4 and h5.'
A sudden sw itch to the queen side which does not seem to be in keeping with all the activity on the other wing.,True,"

Reasoning: The comment accurately indicates that the player made an unexpected move on the queen side, which contrasts with the activity on the other wing, signaling a potential mistake.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19. Be1 Qd7 20. fxg5 fxg5 21. Rxf8+ Rxf8 22. Qe2 c5,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5", Black's recent move to c5 on the queen side appears to deviate from the active play on the opposite wing. This move seems less strategically sound given the current board dynamics.
The Knight looks a little odd on the edge but it has avoided being pinned and the following pawn push provokes a piece exchange which may well be the turning point.,True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake by highlighting the potential risks and benefits of the Knight move and the subsequent pawn push.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19. Be1 Qd7 20. fxg5 fxg5 21. Rxf8+ Rxf8 22. Qe2 c5 23. Nf3 c4 24. Bc2 Bf6 25. e4 g4 26. Nxh4 gxh3,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on h3"," The Knight's position on the edge isn't ideally placed, and the pawn move may lead to an exchange that could potentially shift the game."
Harassing the Queen may not be the best here. Perhaps Bf5 instead.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, suggesting a better alternative move to improve the position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19. Be1 Qd7 20. fxg5 fxg5 21. Rxf8+ Rxf8 22. Qe2 c5 23. Nf3 c4 24. Bc2 Bf6 25. e4 g4 26. Nxh4 gxh3 27. e5 Bxh4 28. Bxh4 Bg4,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g4"," Black's last move with the bishop to g4 seems aggressive but might not be the best strategy. Instead, considering a bishop move to f5 could improve White's position."
Again Black's choice looks doubtful. The Rook may have some defensive role and perhaps even have an attacking square on g7 but ..,True,"

The comment is justifying the move as a potential defensive or even attacking choice, acknowledging the doubts about the decision, which implies the move was not considered optimal.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19.

(as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to f7"," Black's recent Rook move to f7 appears questionable. Its defensive utility is limited, and while it might aim for an attack on g7, the overall position suggests caution."
Trying to run before the Queen drops in.,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it references the common strategy of waiting for the Queen to drop in before proceeding with a certain move, which seems to have been neglected.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19. Be1 Qd7 20. fxg5 fxg5 21. Rxf8+ Rxf8 22. Qe2 c5 23. Nf3 c4 24. Bc2 Bf6 25. e4 g4 26. Nxh4 gxh3 27. e5 Bxh4 28. Bxh4 Bg4 29. Qd2 Rf7 30. Bf6 Kf8,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8", Black's move with the King to f8 isn't advisable.
"This took a while to decide as I had kept thinking I needed to keep both Bishops. But no, this wins material.",True,"

The comment explains that the player initially intended to keep both Bishops but ended up making a move that won material, indicating they made a mistake in their decision.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19.

Bxe7,"This is a game between Salter, D. (as White) and Fereira, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on e7", Black's decision to exchange a Bishop for a Knight on e7 was a material loss.
"And not with the Rook, as then 33. Qh8+ Kf7 34. Rf1+. And not with the King as 33. Bg6 Rf8 34. Qg7 or Qh4+",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake by pointing out the alternative moves that the player should have considered, which would have been more advantageous.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19.

Alternatively, Black could move their Bishop to g6, which would allow White to check with 33. Qg7 or Qh4+."
"Bf5 may have made White work harder, forcing White to win the exchange before his Rook can take up an active role.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that by playing Bf5, White sacrificed the exchange which might have made the game more favorable for Black, as it allowed Black to potentially activate the Rook earlier.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bg5 Ne4 6. Bf4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 e6 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Be6 13. Ne5 f6 14. Ng4 g5 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 Ne7 17. Qc2 h5 18. f4 h4 19.

"Again, Black might prolong matters with Be4",True,"

The comment suggests that the player is trying to buy time, which indicates they are aware of their mistake and are attempting to prolong the inevitable defeat.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

""White could now exploit Black's position, as Be4 would create vulnerabilities."""
"Too late, and my opponent later admitted he had thought I'd played Kg1 here!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it indicates that the player made a move (Kg1) that was not anticipated by the opponent, leading to a later confession of a different intended move.",1.

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by pinning the rook, which limits its mobility and allows the opponent to gain a material advantage.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bg7 5.
