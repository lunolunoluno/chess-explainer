"Believe it or not, this was an origional idea of my own, developed ia a series of OTB games over the past couple of years or so between myself and my local friend, George McRobert, so I was not following theory. Much later during this game I was to discover that this opening sequence of moves had indeed been played before by a number of English Grandmasters from the early 1980's onwards. My own experience with this opening led me to believe that this was a very strong sequence for White to play, and it actually caused George McRobert to discard the St. George from his repertoire, so overwhelming was my score against him with it!!",True,"

The comment provides a detailed explanation of the player's original intentions and experiences with the opening, which could clarify the mistake made.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Macmillen, Andrew (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"," Certainly! Here's the revised comment, simplified to focus on the explanation as to why the move played (Pawn to c4) was considered weak, and in accordance with the guidelines provided:

""Initially, my strategy was not based on deep theory. However, it was during this game that I realized my opening moves had been seen by some English Grandmasters decades ago. Despite my belief in White's potential advantage with this sequence, it proved to be less effective than I had anticipated, causing my opponent, Black, to abandon a previously favored strategy."""
"To illustrat e my own ideas for this type of game I list the following: - 5...b5xc4 6.Bxc4 d5 7.Bd3 c5 8.Be3 c5xd4 (8...Nc6! 9.d4xc5 d4! 10.Bf4 as in Cumming vs Teunisse, a postal friendly as yet to be concluded), 9.Bxd4 Nc6 10.Be3 Nb4 11.0-0 Nxd3 12.Qxd3 Ne7 13.Bc5!

Game 6/7, OTB match, David R Cumming vs George McRobert, Tues 15/12/98.",True,"

The comment provides a thorough analysis of the game, highlighting the mistake made by the player after 8...c5xd4 with the alternative play 8...Nc6, which would lead to a more solid position for Black.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4 Bb4+,"This is a game between Cumming, David R (as White) and Macmillen, Andrew (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4 with check"," In this game, Black played the move 8...c5xd4, which is considered a poor move. Black's intention may have been to counterattack, but this opening up the c-file to White's pieces is not beneficial. This move fails to provide Black with a solid position, allowing White to maintain a positional advantage."
Black wishes to test the soundness of my opening system.,True,"

The comment implies that the move was actually a part of an opening strategy, indicating that it was a purposeful decision rather than a mistake.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6.

"Threatening 9...Bxf3, which would either double my f-pawns or win a pawn, liquidating the White centre in the process, so...",True,"

The comment provides a clear evaluation of the mistake by pointing out the consequences of the player's move, which either exposes the f-pawns or creates a material advantage by capturing a pawn, weakening White's control of the center.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7", 'They should consider that capturing the Bishop with 9...Bxf3 could either create weaknesses by doubling the f-pawns or gain a pawn at the cost of weakening their own center structure.'
"So now what we have is effectively a Winawer French Defence, with thedifference being that Black has exchanged his b-pawn for White's c-pawn and fianchettoed his queen's Bishop, so now ...Bxc3 isn't really much of a threat because White doesn't get doubled c-pawns and b2xc3 further supports the White centre, so White would have no objection to this course of events.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the ineffectiveness of the move...Bxc3 and the strategic advantages for White.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"," White's last move of playing c5 as Black isn't particularly strong. It results in the exchange of a bishop for a pawn, weakening Black's control over the central squares. This move does not create immediate threats for White. Instead, White can maintain a solid position without any significant disadvantages, indicating that Black's play is not effective in this position."
14.Rc1 should have been preffered here.,True,"

The comment accurately indicates that the move 14.Rc1 was a mistake and suggests a better alternative was available.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 bxc4 7. Bxc4 d6 8.

Last move played: White plays kingside castle", 'White's move 14.Rc1 is not ideal because it doesn't improve control over the central squares or develop a piece.
"Letting White off the hook, and simply transposing the game back to what it should have been had I played the corrrect 14.Rc1. The correct move for Black here was the immediate 15...Nc5!, and the Bishop cannot go to b1 because it would block in the Rook, and so White would have to play 16.Bc2, which would slow down his game a fair bit from what actually occured!

The comment does not adequately explain the mistake made by the player as it lacks context and specific details regarding the move's consequences.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6.

To be fair to Black, he had his own ideas of exchanging off his Knight for my Bishop and in the process opening up the long diagonal for his Queen's Bishop, but I refuted this in the following manner....",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out the missed opportunity for queenside play, which could have been advantageous for White.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4.

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the shift in the center of gravity for the White Knight, which signifies a change in strategic focus and potentially a misstep in the player's plan.",1. d4 b5 2. e4 Bb7 3. e5 e6 4.
