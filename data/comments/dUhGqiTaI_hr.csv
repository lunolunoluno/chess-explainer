Dr. Lasker declares his intentions of occupying the center.,True," Yes, the comment indicates a potential strategic goal, suggesting a move that could disrupt the opponent's center.",1.

Alekhine intends to control the center from a distance. The only reason for this pawn move is to allow the fianchetto of the Kingside Bishop.,True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the move, but it’s speculative and doesn’t directly address the flaw in the initial assessment.",1.

"Lasker wants to support the d-pawn by playing e2-e3, but doesn't want to trap the Queenside Bishop behind the pawn chain. So the Bishop comes out first.",True," The comment suggests a tactical reason for the Bishop’s move, potentially hindering the Queenside Bishop’s development.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 g6 3.

Alekhine's hypermodern strategy continues -- he's now planning to fianchetto both Bishops.,True," The comment suggests a potential complication arising from the hypermodern plan, indicating a flaw in the move.",1.

"Alekhine responds by completing his plan of fianchettoing both Bishops. The Bishops are strong, as they both sit on long diagonals. However, the b7-Bishop is the better of the two since its brother runs smack up against the d4-pawn.",True," The comment provides a justification for the mistake, suggesting the fianchettoed Bishops are stronger, which is a key point of contention.",1.

King safety is a must.

"I'm not sure why Lasker played this, as the Black Knight wasn't really threatening to come to g4. Controlling the open c-file by Rc1 would certainly have been more productive.",True," The comment suggests a misjudgement of the potential impact of a specific move, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1.

"White's Rooks are connected; his development is complete. The Queen on e2 serves some useful functions. It backs up the Bishop on the a6-f1 diagonal, plus allows Qxf3 (instead of gxf3) in case Black decides to trade his b7-Bishop for the White Knight.",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting the Queen's function and the fallback option are irrelevant to the error.",1.

Alekhine suspected that White wanted to force a trade of Bishops by playing Ba6 (eliminating the very well-posted b7-Bishop). Now that move is impossible as both the a8-Rook and b7-Bishop control a6.,True," The comment identifies a potential tactical blunder and explains why it’s invalid, demonstrating an understanding of the position.",1.

Alekhine is switching his attention to the Queenside. It's not going to be easy for White to counter -- it's harder for him to switch his pieces to that side of the board.,True," The comment suggests a potential weakness in White's ability to respond to the move, indicating a strategic flaw.",1.

"This move seems odd, but has a purpose. Lasker intends to play Rc2 followed by Rdc1 to double his Rooks on the open c-file. Getting the Knight out of the way allows the Queen to support the c2-Rook.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic objective.",1.

"Now this is interesting. Black seems to be stymied on the Queenside; since his pieces are concentrated on the a- through c-files, Lasker suddenly switches his attention to the Kingside.",True," The comment suggests a strategic shift indicating a potential tactical advantage for Black, potentially due to the repositioning of pieces.",1.

"To make Nxd3 possible.
