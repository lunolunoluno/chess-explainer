Certainly an annoying move order against Najdorf junkies.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it refers to an undesirable move order in a Najdorf Defense, indicating a weakness in the player's understanding of this specific opening.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3,"This is a game between Plaskett, James (as White) and Shipov, Sergei (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"
"10... Nh6 was probably better. Far from stopping white's kingside play, this weakens e6, forming the basis for some nice knight maneuvers in the next few moves.",True,"

Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. O-O Bg7 7. d3 a6 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. Kh1 Qd7 10. Qe2 f5,"This is a game between Plaskett, James (as White) and Shipov, Sergei (as Black).

The knights are homing in on the weak e6 and b6 squares.,True,"

A very nice game. Black was made to look like a complete beginner.,True,"
