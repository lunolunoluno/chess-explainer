"Kasparov, on commenting this game for the press, did not say much about the opening. ""Neither of us is an expert in this variation, I did nothing special and just made ordinary, sound moves."" But at this point in the game Kasparov had had a vision that would have ocurred to few others: to bring over his queen from h6 to b6, into the attack.",True," The comment suggests Kasparov’s vision was unusual, indicating a potential mistake.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

"Here (and in fact already a few moves earlier) Kasparov had calculated exactly that he had a draw in hand and his intuition told him that there should be more. Then, while Topalov was pondering on his reply, Kasparov saw everything to the end to move 39. This may seem incredible, but there is no reason to doubt his words, as from this point on he played all his moves with amazing speed.",True," The comment highlights Kasparov’s intuition and speed, suggesting a potential flaw in his evaluation of the position.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
