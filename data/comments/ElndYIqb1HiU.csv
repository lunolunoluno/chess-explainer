I like this rather unusual move and play it myself too. It's idea - to prevent the quite unpleasant move Bf8-c5 with pressure on f2.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it acknowledges the player tried to prevent the opponent's potential bad move and create pressure, indicating they understood their move's purpose.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"," ""The move e3 by White aims to control the f4 square, preventing Black from playing Bf8-c5, which would exert pressure on White's f2 pawn."""
"If I'm not mistaken it's Boleslavsky's idea. Of course it's a more common approach to take with a pawn towards the centre, but here White has a concrete purpose: to exploit the ""backward"" c7 pawn . To do this, White opens the c-file and tries to prevent c7-c5. The next White goal: to exchange black-squared bishops and occupy black square with pieces.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic purpose of the move, identifying it as Boleslavsky's idea, and explains the concrete goal White aims to achieve by exploiting the ""backward"" c7 pawn.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on b3"," In this position, White sacrifices a pawn on b3, which seems risky. White's intention is to open the c-file and aim to control the ""backward"" c7 pawn. They're also trying to get rid of Black's bishop to gain influence on the black squares."
"In the near future White's knight will be better than Black's e6 bishop, so it's useful to prevent a possible exchange.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by pointing out the potential threat to White's knight posed by Black's e6 bishop and suggests proactive action to prevent the possible exchange.",1. e4 e5 2.

It's important to avoid giving Black a chance to trade the bishop for White's knight.
The c7 pawn stopped by two white pieces! Also the e6 bishop hasn't got any outlets.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the player's mistake by highlighting the blocked pawn and the lack of activity for the bishop, suggesting a passive and potentially weak position.",1. e4 e5 2.

Reformulated to simplify and ensure clarity:
White's move was poorly planned, exposing the c7 pawn and limiting the e6 bishop's mobility."
"It is redundant on the c-file now, so the rook comes nearer to the opponent's king...",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that placing a piece on the c-file restricts the opponent's rook, which is a common tactical motive in chess.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

"Of course Black didn't want to weaken his black squares more, but what else to do? After",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it lacks specific information about the position, the move made, and the consequences of that move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

A sign for storm.,True,"

The comment ""A sign for storm"" metaphorically indicates a sudden and unexpected move, suggesting that the player's move deviated significantly from the standard strategy, akin to a storm disrupting a calm situation.",1. e4 e5 2.

"As you can see, White plays only on black squares.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake, as White's move only attacks squares on Black's side of the board, which is a weakness in their position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5.
