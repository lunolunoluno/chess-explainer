A15: English Opening: 1...Nf6,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake, as 1...Nf6 in the English Opening is not an ideal response to 1.c4, as it allows White to play d4 without immediate resistance.",1. Nf3,"This is a game between Kramnik, V. (as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"," ""A15: English Opening: Black's move 1...Nf6 is considered suboptimal as it does not conform to the typical strategies of the English opening, which White usually anticipates."""

(as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to a3"," The recent move by Black involved placing the Bishop on a3, which wasn't particularly strong or strategic."
gives the opponent counterplay,True,"

O-O Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Re1 d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. e4 Nxc3 10. bxc3 Nc6 11. d4 Na5 12. h4 Re8 13. h5 h6 14. Ne5 Bd6 15. Bf4 Qe7 16. Qg4 Kh8 17. Nd3 Rad8 18. Rad1 Bc6 19. e5 Ba3 20. Bxc6 Nxc6 21.

(as White) and Karpov, An (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5", Black's pawn move to c5 doesn't contribute to the game's development and offers little in terms of strategic advantage.
"not a good decision, because now the opponent is right back in the game",True,"
