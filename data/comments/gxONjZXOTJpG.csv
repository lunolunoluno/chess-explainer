"Now white wins smoothly. The question posed by my computer is this: how to win after 28...h4. Moreover, how to equalize?? Well, white has played all of the right moves and, further, black has two pieces marooned on the queenside while his king is exposed. Therefore, at first I naturally assumed that white had something. But I can't find it! The computers are very powerful advocates for concrete variations over generalities, and they tenaciously find resources for the material grabber. Chess thought is already being re-evaluated in many variations (like the Poisoned Pawn, where white can no longer just ""say"" he has compensation), and this may be one more example.",True," The comment highlights a potential over-reliance on specific, concrete variations and suggests a struggle with general strategic thinking, indicating a player's difficulty with the overall position.",1. c4 c5 2.
