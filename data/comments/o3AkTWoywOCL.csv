"Black's opening seems particularly aimed at preventing any Sozin-like variation (Qc7 makes Bf1-c4 unlikely) or a Richter (Bc1-g5 to pin a Nf6) as there is no Nf6.

With two open files occupied by rooks it appears Black has adequate compensation for the backward Pd7.

"It's not so easy for Black to find a very good plan here. Certainly Pa2, Pb2 and Pc5 are worth attacking, but he must also realize White can fight with f2-f4-f5 to undermine Nd5 and to weaken Kg8. There is also Bxd5 cxd5 to mobilize Pc5.

"White's pieces look active, but they get in each other's way. Ideally he'd like to get his queen in front of Bd3 (at e4 for example) to attack Kh8, but he can't because Re2 is in the way.

"This seems aggressive because he's keeping his king safe and still expecting to break through on the queen-side. To capture Pb2 and allow White to succeed in the attack on Kf7 wouldn't be good.
