"Up to here, I'd been following Karpov-Korchnoi 1974. Douglas now surprises me with his reply - I'd expected 0-0 or Bd7.",True,"

The comment implies that the player was expecting a particular move (0-0 or Bd7) based on the game's opening, but Douglas played an unexpected move, indicating a mistake according to the player's expectations.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
"With Douglas seemingly intent on not castling, I thought I'd be a touch perverse and invite a further K-side advance.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that Douglas's decision not to castle led to an opportunity for the opponent to advance on the kingside.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"
Trying to be consistent with one of the original objectives of the opening - removal of the fianchettoed Bishop.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake, as it does not identify the specific move that was made incorrectly.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8.

To keep the Queens on.,False,"

The comment does not specify what mistake was made or why it was a mistake, hence it does not explain the error.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9.

Last move played: White plays King to h1"
Here I felt White had the better position.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it simply expresses the reviewer's opinion on the overall position without specifying the error in the move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
But now Black recovers lost ground with some energetic play.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it simply states the opponent's subsequent beneficial actions, without addressing any errors in the player's previous move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

Reactivating White's Queen and stirring up some tactical play was more important than the b2 pawn.,True,"

The comment indicates that the player prioritized tactical play by reactivating the Queen, which suggests that the mistake was made in favor of creating an attacking opportunity rather than maintaining pawn structure.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

Last move played: White plays Queen to a3"
"#This seems a natural response to break the pin, but it is probably the losing move. The Knight is now dangerously marginalised. Nd1 looks better.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake as a losing move due to vulnerability of the Knight and suggests a better option, Nd1.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19. Qxh4 Bf5 20. c3 Nd5 21. Ng3 Ne3 22.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to c2"
1 defender gone.,True,"

The comment ""1 defender gone"" accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it implies a piece was captured by the opponent, leaving the player's position weakened.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

(as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f5"
2 defenders gone.,True,"

The comment ""2 defenders gone"" accurately explains the mistake as it indicates the player lost two defensive pieces, likely contributing to a significant weakness in their position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

(as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to f4 with check"
3 defenders gone.,False,"

The comment ""3 defenders gone"" does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only indicates the potential threat to the piece(s) left behind, not the specific error.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

Kg1 Rb1+,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b1 with check"
Douglas decides to give up the Knight and flushes out the White King.,True,"
The comment accurately describes the player's move as a mistake because Douglas (player) is giving up a valuable Knight for no apparent benefit, potentially weakening his position and allowing White to exploit the situation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

Kf2 Qh4+,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h4 with check"
Qxa7+ looks more efficient with hindsight.,True,"

The comment suggests that the move Qxa7+ was less optimal than the player initially thought, implying they made a mistake by choosing this move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19. Qxh4 Bf5 20. c3 Nd5 21.

Bxc2,"This is a game between Mackintosh, I. (as White) and Livie, D. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c2"
"The White King has survived his cross-country trek, and although Bishop for 3 pawns looks equal, White's superior mobiity gives the edge.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the White King's survival, the apparent material equality between the bishop and three pawns, and finally, the decisive factor of White's superior mobility.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

Last move played: Black plays Queen to d6"
Rg2 or Rg6 might be improvements here.,True,"

The comment correctly suggests an alternative move to improve the current position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11.

"If now Rg6, 48.Rb7 and the Black c-pawn goes.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it gives a clear and logical consequence of the move that weakens the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19. Qxh4 Bf5 20. c3 Nd5 21.

The a-pawn needs to stay on.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake because it indicates that the a-pawn was moved to a vulnerable position, which is typically a blunder in chess.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19. Qxh4 Bf5 20. c3 Nd5 21.

"If Rxc4, 51.Bxf5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it shows that taking the rook on c4 with the queen would be a strong move, leaving the white bishop unprotected and allowing for a counterattack with Bxf5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

The a-pawn can't be stopped now.,True,"

The comment accurately describes a common mistake where a pawn advances without considering the possibility of being attacked, leading to potential loss of the pawn or positional disadvantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 h5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bc4 Qc7 11. O-O h4 12. h3 Bd7 13. Rad1 Nh5 14. Bd4 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Rf8 16. Ne2 Rd8 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19.

"No brilliancy prizes, but good robust stuff!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it only refers to the general quality of the move as ""good robust stuff,"" which does not provide specific feedback or address the error in the move.",1. e4 c5 2.
