"Thanks to White's passive handling of this opening, Black already has the much better of it. His advantages are: 1) His Bishop on d6 more active than White's on e2 2) His Knight on c6 more active than White's on d2 After the last move he also has a third advantage - the weakening of White's castled position. This is all the more serious in that Black has not yet castled, and so can throw up his Kingside pawns without endgangering his own King. This sort of thing is an accepted part of opening theory",True," The comment offers a critical analysis of a potential tactical weakness and suggests a strategic move that undermines Whiteâ€™s advantage, indicating a significant mistake.",1. d4 e6 2.
