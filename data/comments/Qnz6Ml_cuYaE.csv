"Not having faced this opening for about 15 years I show my ignorance. Better is Nf3, Be2 and 0-0 which gives White a clear edge.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it references a lack of familiarity with the opening, and suggests an alternative line that would give White a better position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"
"Black intends Be7, Nh7 and Bg5 eliminating his bad Bishop.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake because it only states the intended move without mentioning the specific error made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
To obtain any advantage it is important to avoid the Bishop exchange. My plan is to meet a Bg5 with Bf2 and h4.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake, indicating that avoiding the Bishop exchange is crucial for gaining an advantage, and suggests alternative strategies like playing Bf2 and h4.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"
Now I want to castle queenside and use a pawn storm against the Black King. Unfortunately I can't play Qd2 because after Black plays Bg5 I could no longer play the necessary Bf2.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it outlines the issues with moving the queen to d2 and the potential consequences of that move in response to Black's Bg5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle"
I was tempted by b4 but was unsure what to do with my King after it.,True,"

The comment reveals that the player made a move that was unsure of what to do with their king afterwards, which indicates a mistake in the decision-making process.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
This wastes two tempi. Better is Bd7.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move wasted time by not developing a piece, and a better move would be Bd7 to improve the position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to h5"
I was tempted to play the immediate h4 but became confused by Black's h5.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it reflects their own confusion when considering an aggressive move (h4) but ultimately deciding against it due to Black's presence on h5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g3"
I didn't like this move at the time and like it even les now. I wanted to play Qh2 but felt Black could probably reply with Qb6. However this is much better than what I played.,True,"
The comment describes a player's regret over a chess move, implying that it was a mistake they made, which aligns with the evaluation of the move as a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c5"
Sacrifices the h-pawn but it is not clear how I proceed afterwards. h5 is met by g5. Meanwhile Black has a queenside attack.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out the potential weakness of the pawn structure and the lack of clear follow-up options.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18.

"if 20...Qxg5+ 21.Kb1 and after Rdg1 White has a strong attack. After Qe7 I am forced into winning a pawn, but giving up my attack because Black now threatens to play hxg5 because the Queen defends the Knight on h7.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential loss of an attack and the need to give up a pawn to avoid a worse position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18. Qh2 Bd6 19. g5 g6 20. h5 Qe7,"This is a game between Giulian, P. (as White) and Neuvonen, O. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7"
Now I was concerned. My attack seems to be going nowhere whereas Black's attack is underway.,True,"

The comment indicates that the player's attack was ineffective, while the opponent's attack was successful, which explains the mistake made by the player in their previous move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18.

"I have no idea whether this is a good move or not! However if I do nothing I will be swamped on the queenside. My idea is to vacate d5 for the Knight. This together with Nd2, f4 and Nf3 seemed very promising albeit at the cost of two or three pawns.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses the potential vulnerability on the queenside and the strategic idea behind vacating d5 for the Knight, indicating the player's thought process behind the move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18.

Possibly the losing move although I think I have a definite advantage. Better to save a tempo with the immediate Rxd6.,True,"

The comment reflects the evaluator's belief that the move played may have been a mistake but acknowledges a potential advantage for the opponent, suggesting a better alternative with Rxd6.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3.

Nc3 Nbd7 4. e4 e5 5. d5 h6 6. Be3 Be7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bd3 Nc5 9. Bc2 c6 10. Nge2 cxd5 11. cxd5 Qb6 12. Qd2 Nh5 13. O-O-O Nf6 14. g4 Bd7 15. Ng3 Nh7 16. h4 Qd8 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18.

and Black resigns because there is no way to meet the threats of Rg2 and Nxf7 followed by Rxh7+.,True,"
