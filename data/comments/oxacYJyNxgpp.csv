"I'm going to leave the theoretical debate to the Opening experts. However, White's move is not bad.

A move that is very subjective. Personally I think the Bishop belongs on d6. 10...Bd6 is much more aggressive since the Bishop has plans for the Kingside. Also the square f4 tends to be a key post for White in the Tarrasch. The advantage of the Bishop at b6 is that it freezes the Rook at f1.,True," The comment offers specific reasoning for the mistake, suggesting the Bishop's placement is suboptimal due to tactical and positional considerations.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Brave. This move baits 13. Bxh6 when you have the choice between 13...gxh6 and 13...Ne4.

"White's move is not bad. The idea is to attempt an ""instant"" endgame where White's pawn structure is superior.

Ouch again. Try 24...Rb6. The Knight without a target is only taking up space. I know the proverbial idea of taking away the Knight's advance points but in this case it opens the door for White to gain a comfortable position. When you have positional justification - ATTACK! The move ...g6 can be played later.

O.K. Your GM returns the favor. 25. Rae1 grabs space and almost wins the endgame by force. You might benefit by the study of isolated pawn play. The isolated pawn is safely blocked. Controlling the e-file would cut off the support of the King. The fatal attack on the blocked pawn must come either from behind or beside the pawn. This can't be achieved with the Rook on d1.

"Nice! This is about the only chance you have to protect your weakness. White should now shift the attention to immobilizing the a-pawn and finding a way to pile up against it.

"28...Ne3 is probably your last chance to win. However, it's not likely that an advantage could be generated off this move.

Your opponent seems to be counting on the general ignorance of endgames among the average population. This move demonstrates a keen understanding of the endgame.
