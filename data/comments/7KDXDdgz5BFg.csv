"In the patent Nimzowitsch style. He gets in Pa4 now, anticpating that sooner or later Black will have to play ... Pb6. There is an incidental threat of Ba3. Another important Nimzowitsch dogma was that the Bishop should sustain the hanging pawns from e2 - not from d3. This, to say the least, is a debatable point, as our previous examples have shown White's prospect of attack will be better with the Bishop on d3, than if it is on e2. However, the dictum of Nimzowitsch is sound enough in the sense that as a defender pure and simple the Bishop functions better at e2",True," The comment provides a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic consideration related to the Bishop's placement.",1. e4 c5 2.

White is content to defend. In view of the state of the tournament score it is understandable that Nimzowitsch sought no more than a draw from this game,True, The comment suggests the player’s assessment of the game’s outcome and a specific opening theory (Nimzowitsch) demonstrates a lack of ambition or desire for a significant advantage.,1. e4 c5 2.
