"In some cases this restrains Pe4 sufficient to allow ...Ng8-f6, but in some other cases Black needs more control of e5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the potential consequences of the move, noting that it can either be beneficial by allowing...Ng8-f6 or detrimental by requiring more control over e5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"Now Black has to decide how to prevent Nxc6 and e4-e5. To that end Black has played ...d6 (Scheveningen) , ...e5 (Sveshnikov) and ...Qb6 (Benko) . All have good qualities.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by stating that Black has several options to prevent Nxc6 and e4-e5, indicating that the player's move was not optimal and needed a better response to avoid losing material or facing a disadvantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"
If White doesn't try to exploit the weakness at d6 then his pieces become too passive.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it correctly identifies the issue of White's pieces becoming passive due to not exploiting the weakness at d6, which is a fundamental strategic error in chess.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5"
threatening ...b4 and preventing Na3-c4-e3,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move was a mistake as it not only allows for black's...b4, which could create problems in the center of the board, but also prevents the white's knight maneuver Na3-c4-e3, which could have been part of the player's strategy.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
"It seems odd that Black would allow such a pawn structure, but he can't easily be prevented from ...f6-f5xe4 to give him an advantage in central pawns. That the position has many weaknesses gives White room to develop and fight for a win.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that Black's pawn structure is weak and White has opportunities to exploit it.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f6"
"After Ne7 it appears Black might prefer ...Bc8-b7, as is played in many Sicilian Defense games, to cut through the center of the board and to aim at Pg2, where White's king might soon reside.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the potential mistake made by the player, as moving the knight from f3 to e7 followed by...Bc8-b7 could indeed be a weakening move in the context of a Sicilian Defense.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e7"
"Seeing that the piece needed to be improved and that d5 would be a good spot for it, she moves it now.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player by suggesting that the piece should have been improved and indicating a better move (d5) instead.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c2"
"It might be a little unusual to use this move when Bg7 blocks the g-file, but Kasparov has played the King's Indian Defense many times and understands how to handle the weak d5 and the open g-file. In this case he might not aim directly for an attack on Pg2 and Kg1. Instead he might just be preventing Ne3 or exf5, so he can return to ...Bc8-b7 with either ...f5 or ...d5 soon to follow. Kasparov is very much about achieving good overall piece activity.",True,"

This comment provides a clear explanation for the move, taking into account Kasparov's style and the strategic goals he might be pursuing in the King's Indian Defense.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15.

"threatening ...Bh3 to checkmate with ...Qxg2# or to force g2-g3, so ...Bh3xf1 will win material and continue to weaken Kg1",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it identifies the immediate threats posed by the move...Bh3, including checkmate threats with Qxg2# and forcing g2-g3 to win material.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to g5"
These moves are very much taken from a King's Indian Defense player's repertoire.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it just identifies a common opening played in the King's Indian Defense, which does not necessarily imply a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19. Bc4 Kh8,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to h8"
Kasparov is always on the lookout for tactical shots which he can use to win or confuse the opponent.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it refers to Kasparov's tactical strategy, which does not directly relate to the player's move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19. Bc4 Kh8 20. Rf2 Be7 21. Nb4 d5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"
"offering Ra8 is just the sort of audacious thing Kasparov is noted for. But, don't think it's just a bluff. He's calculated variations to determine if his compensation is sufficient.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it seems to justify the move instead of critiquing it.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9.

Bxd5 Bc5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5"
"Material is nominally equal, but the exposed Kd3 could be a problem.",True,"

The comment accurately points out a potential weakness in the player's move by highlighting the exposed King, which could lead to a tactical disadvantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19. Bc4 Kh8 20. Rf2 Be7 21.

"It's odd to see all these Black pieces cramped into the corner, but Black threatens ...Bf1 to win a queen!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights a weakness in Black's position by pointing out the cramped placement of Black's pieces, and the potential threat they pose to capture White's queen.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19.

Qd3 Bh3,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to h3"
"It's a little surprising, after what had gone before, to see simplification; Black has a passed Ph7 and wants to advance it, so the h-file had to be cleared.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the strategic oversight of simplifying the position when Black has a strong passed pawn on the seventh rank, which could become a decisive factor in the game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19.

Qc2 Qxc2+,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on c2 with check"
"I suppose he's decided he can't just run Ph7 forward because Pc4 is also in good shape to advance and White's pieces might suddenly swarm Kg7. So, he has to continue the fight and await further simplifications when his king will be safer, then the pawns can advance.",True,"

The comment correctly explains that the player's choice to avoid advancing the pawn to f7 (Ph7) was strategic, considering the potential threats from the opponent's pieces, particularly the potential advance of the opponent's pawn to c5 (Pc4), which could open up possibilities for the opponent's pieces to attack the king on g7.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19.

prevents White's king from running to a2 (via b3) to get away from checks,True,"

This comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the potential escape route for the opponent's king and suggests that the move played might have inadvertently allowed the opponent's king to escape from checks.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19.

clearing the way for ...f4-f3 and perhaps teasing Polgar into Nxe5?? Maybe Black has a won position anyway. White's pawns can't advance yet and with Be3 preventing Ra6-a7 there's no attack on Kg7. This is the moment for pawn advances.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by suggesting a better pawn move and pointing out the weakness of the opponent's position, indicating that advancing pawns could have been a strategic move instead of the played move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 Bg7 11. c3 f5 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. O-O O-O 15. Nc2 f4 16. a4 bxa4 17. Rxa4 Qg5 18. f3 Bf6 19.
