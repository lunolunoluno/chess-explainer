"The Fischer favourite - the Poisoned Pawn variation! Bobby's had a phenominal record with this line: a near 80% score with the Black pieces. If you don't count Efim Geller (his bete noire) using Fischer's pet-line against the man himself (Monte Carlo, 1967), Bobby only ever lost one game with it - to Boris Spassky in their epic 1972 Reykjavic match.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it simply discusses Bobby Fischer's success with the Poisoned Pawn variation and does not address the specific move played in the current game.",1. e4 c5 2.

The cautious approach. This just leads to a sort of main line Najdorf.,True,"

The comment seems to imply that the player missed a better or more aggressive option to continue a well-known variation (the Najdorf), suggesting it was a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

Last move played: White plays Knight to b3"," ""White's recent move of Knight to b3 shows a lack of strategic depth, potentially advancing toward a well-known opening sequence like the Najdorf."""
"Leko's a pawn ahead but, with the domination of the d-file and the active king should it go into a rook and pawn ending, Kasparov can easily hold.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses general positions and potential outcomes rather than analyzing the specific flawed move.",1. e4 c5 2.

Leko repeats a few moves to make the time control in safety.,False,"

The comment is more about the player's strategy in managing their time rather than evaluating the quality of the chess move played.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.

The comment does not fully explain the mistake as it lacks information about the specific move played and the game situation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.
