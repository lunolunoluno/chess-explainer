The Salvio Gambit,False,"

The comment ""The Salvio Gambit"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it refers to a specific chess opening rather than the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e5,-
Guarding his f7 and developing his knight. Later 6...Nc6 was shown to refute the Salvio. A long analysis begins with 7. Nxf7 Bc5 8. Qe1 g3 9. Nxh8 Bf2.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the flawed decision to play 6...Nc6, which allows the continuation of the refuted Salvio variation.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to h6," White's decision to play 6...Nc6 was a critical error. It directly challenges the safety of their f7 pawn, which they had previously been guarding. This move also directly contradicts the strategy suggested by Salvio, which was designed to exploit weaknesses in Black's position. Following this move, White's position becomes vulnerable, leading to a series of tactical sequences that begin with 7. Nxf7 Bc5, 8. Qe1 g3, and culminating in 9. Nxh8 Bf2."
Taking possession of d4 protecting his knight thus making it more secure and opening the line of his queen bishop.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because taking control of d4 to protect a knight does not necessarily make the move a mistake, and it does not inherently open the line of the queen's bishop.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4,-
Developing with a tempo.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because it refers to a good practice of developing pieces with a tempo, but the move in question might have been a loss of tempo, such as moving a piece without a clear purpose or without any immediate threats.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6,-
The only move.,False,"

The comment ""The only move"" does not explain the mistake made by the player; it merely indicates that there was no other option available at that point in the game.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d3,-
This pawn was doubly threatened.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it only states that a pawn was doubly threatened, which does not necessarily indicate a poor move.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f3,-
9. g2xg3? would expose White's king too much after 9...gxf3 followed by Bh3+.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move g2xg3, as it would lead to a disadvantageous exchange that exposes the White king to potential threats from Black's bishop and h3 pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3," ""9. g2xg3? This move is a critical blunder. After Black captures the pawn with 9...gxf3, White's king is left vulnerable following Black's bishop move to h3+."""
If Qh3+? 10. Ke1 Qg2? 11. Nf2 and the Queen is trapped.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a tactical error made by the player, suggesting the loss of the Queen if the moves continue as proposed.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7," Black's move Qh3+ leads to a quick check, but it is not the best choice. White responds with Ke1 to avoid the check. Black's next move Qg2 seems to be a mistake as it fails to address White's potential counterplay. White can then play Nf2, placing the Black Queen in a precarious position, leading to potential trapping."
Developing and guarding the king pawn.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the move was a basic and expected one for developing and defending the king's pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3, The move by White to Knight to c3 does not effectively develop their pieces nor does it provide any significant protection to the king pawn.
Developing and offering the exchange of bishops. After 11. Bxe6 fxe6 White's queen knight would no longer exert pressure on his d5. 11. Bb3 is best now.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it outlines the repercussions of the move and suggests an improved alternative.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6," After 11. Bxe6, Black's decision to capture White's bishop on e6 was not the best move. This piece exchange would relieve pressure on Black's d5 pawn. The better move for White would be 11. Bb3, maintaining a strong presence on the board and keeping an eye on Black's position."
The prelude to an enterprising knight sacrifice which Anderssen however with ingenious play refutes.,False,"

The comment does not seem to explain the mistake made by the player, as it mentions a potential strategy (knight sacrifice) that was not executed, suggesting an alternative play rather than the mistake itself.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5,-
Without this follow up White's last move would simply be bad for it blocks his king bishop diagonal denies his knight d5 and leaves his e5 and d4 squares weak.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the consequences of the move, including blocking the bishop, denying the knight, and weakening key squares.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5," White's last move is flawed because it restricts their bishop's movement, prevents their knight from advancing to d5, and weakens the control over the e5 and d4 squares."
Bringing the bishop to this active position with tempo the beginning of the attack.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it actually praises the player's move for bringing the bishop to an active position with tempo.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4,-
14...Qh5 planning Qh3+ might look better in view of White's dangerous looking reply but Black is ready for it. After 14...Qh5 15. Qd4 the position becomes wild.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, indicating that the move 14...Qh5 appears to be a good plan against White's reply, but the position becomes unfavorable after the sequence develops further.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to g7," In this situation, Black's move to play Qh5 is not ideal. Although their plan might involve Qh3+ to threaten White, they should prepare for White's aggressive response. If Black continues with 14...Qh5 and White plays 15. Qd4, the game quickly becomes highly unpredictable."
Threatening Nxc7+ winning the rook. If 15...Bxb5 16. Bxb5+ Nd7 17. Bxc7 White's bishops are dangerous if 15...Na6 16.Qe1+ Kd8 17. d6 with a powerful attack.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the significant threat they exposed by allowing Nxc7+, indicating the loss of the rook and the potential for further damaging attacks on White's position.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5," Black's last move was a blunder, threatening Nxc7+ which would win the rook. If Black responds with 15...Bxb5, White can continue with 16. Bxb5+ Nd7, then 17. Bxc7. This sequence puts White's bishops in a potent position. If Black tries to defend with 15...Na6, White can play 16.Qe1+ and force the King to d8, followed by 17.d6, launching a devastating attack."
With this clever move Black offers the exchange after 16. Bxd6 cxd6 17. Nc7+ Kd8 18. Nxa8 Nf5 the advantage would be Black's. His pieces are active while White's knight is useless at a8.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting that Black's active pieces would outweigh White's isolated knight, leading to Black's advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6," Black's decision to exchange knights after 16...cxd6 17. Nc7+ Kd8 18. Nxa8 doesn't significantly benefit them. Their pieces remain more active, but White's knight on a8 is quite ineffective."
Preventing Black from castling and preparing to bring the Queen to the attack.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it suggests a good strategic approach rather than explaining why a move was wrong.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e1 with check,-
Part of the same attacking plan begun with his last move.,True,"

The comment is explaining the mistake because it suggests the player's move is part of an ongoing attack, indicating they may have overlooked the opponent's response or potential counterattacks.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on d6," 'White's last move was part of the same attacking strategy initiated by them. However, this move might not have been the best choice considering the position on the board.'"
Threatening 19. Nxd6 with enormous pressure..18...Bxb5 would give up a vital defensive piece.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the weakness created by the player's move and the potential gain for the opponent.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to b4," White's move of Queen to b4 applies significant pressure, but 18...Bxb5 would lose an important defensive piece."
Guarding the queen pawn. 19. Nxd6 would accomplish nothing now Black would simply exchange knights.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the futility of the move 19. Nxd6 in the given position.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f5," ""White's last move leaves their queen pawn under threat. Attempting to take the knight with 19. Nxd6 fails to improve White's position, as Black would recapture with their knight."""
Threatening 20. Bxf5 followed by 21. Nxd6.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player as it provides a potential follow-up plan that exposes the vulnerability in the player's position.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3," ""White's last move, Bishop to d3, significantly weakens their position by exposing their bishop to attacks."""
With this and his succeeding move Black blocks White's queen off from the diagonal on which it threatens his queen pawn.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a strategic mistake, as it explains how Black's move blocks White's queen, preventing it from attacking the queen pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3 Na6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a6," In this situation, Black's last move, moving their knight to a6, inadvertently obstructs White's queen from the diagonal it previously targeted at the queen pawn."
Expecting of course 21...Bxf5 after which he would play 22. Nxd6. White would then win his piece back for Black's bishop and knight would be threatened simultaneously. It would then be anybody's game.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies a strong tactical sequence that would have put the opponent in a difficult position, potentially leading to material gain for the player.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3 Na6 20. Qa3 Nc5 21. Bxf5,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on f5," Black plays 21...Bxf5, then White recaptures with 22. Nxd6. This recapture allows White to trade the bishop for Black's knight and bishop, while also posing a threat to Black's knight on d6. This move creates a complex situation where Black must navigate threats, leading to a highly dynamic and unpredictable game."
What a shock this must have been to White! Black now threatens Qd2 which would force mate. From this square Black threatens Qe2+ 23. Kg1 Qg2#. White could not defend with Rg1 or Re1 for Black would mate on e2 in the first case and g2 in the second.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by White by highlighting the threat Black poses to their king with Qe2+ and Qg2#, and also explaining why White's potential defensive moves (Rg1 or Re1) would still not be sufficient to avoid mate.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3 Na6 20. Qa3 Nc5 21. Bxf5 Qh6,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h6," Black's last move threatened Qd2, which would have forced White into checkmate. Regardless of the defensive move White could make, Black could continue attacking. If White tried Rg1 or Re1, Black could still mate on e2 or g2, respectively."
The only move. If 22. Re1 Qh3+ and Qg2#. If 22. Rg1 Qh3+ 23. Ke1 Re8+ 24. Kd1 Qxh2 wins. If then 25. Re1 Rxe1+ 26. Kxe1 Qe2#.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the critical mistake made by the player by illustrating the potentially decisive moves that could have been played after the previous move.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3 Na6 20. Qa3 Nc5 21. Bxf5 Qh6 22. Bd3,This is a game between  Steinitz  (as White) and  Anderssen  (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3," The decision to play Bishop to d3 was a mistake. Black's best response was Qh3+, followed by Qg2#, but White could counter with Rg1. If Black then played Qh3+ again, White could continue with Ke1, Re8+, and Kd1, leading to a winning position for Black with Qxh2. However, if White retreats with Re1, Black has a forced move with Rxe1+, and upon White's capture with Kxe1, Black delivers a checkmate with Qe2#."
Threatening Qh3+ and Qg2#. White's reply is forced.,False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it only presents a strategic follow-up move without addressing the error.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Ne5 Qh4+ 6. Kf1 Nh6 7. d4 d6 8. Nd3 f3 9. g3 Qe7 10. Nc3 Be6 11. d5 Bd7 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Bf4 Qg7 15. Nb5 Bd6 16. Qe1+ Kd8 17. Bxd6 cxd6 18. Qb4 Nf5 19. Bd3 Na6 20. Qa3 Nc5 21. Bxf5 Qh6 22.
