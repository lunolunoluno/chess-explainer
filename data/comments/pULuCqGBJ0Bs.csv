Korchnoi's patent - this way he played with Akesson in Antwerpen 1995.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player as it references an unrelated event and does not provide any analysis of the move.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5.

Drowsing black's attention.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to suggest that the player was not paying attention, rather than providing insight into why the move was a mistake.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Be7 7. e4 O-O 8. Nf3 d6 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Bf4 Rc8 12. Re1 a6 13. Bf1 Qc7 14. b4 Rfd8 15. Rc1 Ne5 16.

"Exellent move with the idea a4,a5",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake as 'excellent' is an incorrect assessment for a made move, and 'a4,a5' does not provide enough context to evaluate the move's quality.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Be7 7. e4 O-O 8. Nf3 d6 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Bf4 Rc8 12. Re1 a6 13. Bf1 Qc7 14. b4 Rfd8 15. Rc1 Ne5 16. Nd2 Qb8 17. h3 Bc6 18. Qe2 Ng6 19. Bg3 Qb7 20.

The simplest way. Also winnig was after 32.Qa6,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a simple mistake, mentioning a winning move (""winnig"") that could be played after the given move, suggesting the player missed a chance to win.",1. c4 c5 2.

Strange move...but it works!,True,"

The comment implies that the move may not have been the best choice, but it still resulted in a satisfactory position for the player.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Be7 7. e4 O-O 8. Nf3 d6 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Bf4 Rc8 12. Re1 a6 13. Bf1 Qc7 14. b4 Rfd8 15. Rc1 Ne5 16. Nd2 Qb8 17. h3 Bc6 18. Qe2 Ng6 19. Bg3 Qb7 20. Nb3 h6 21.

"There were two ways to win immediatly:36.Rd2!, 37.Rdb2 +- or more simple 36.Rdb1 Be4 37.fe Rb3 38.Rb3 d5 39.Rd3 +-.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it provides two alternative winning moves that were immediately available.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Be7 7. e4 O-O 8. Nf3 d6 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Bf4 Rc8 12. Re1 a6 13. Bf1 Qc7 14. b4 Rfd8 15. Rc1 Ne5 16. Nd2 Qb8 17. h3 Bc6 18. Qe2 Ng6 19. Bg3 Qb7 20. Nb3 h6 21.

Searching for a counterplay.,False,"

The comment ""Searching for a counterplay"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only indicates the player's intention to find a strategic response, rather than assessing the quality of their previous move.",1. c4 c5 2.

"Now all white pieces is good, black pawns are stopped, so it must be winning.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it incorrectly states that ""all white pieces are good"" when only the last move is mentioned, and it also assumes victory without considering potential black responses or further complications on the board.",1. c4 c5 2.

Long forsing line finished and black have now some draw chances,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as the long forced line allowed black to reach positions with draw chances.",1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5.
