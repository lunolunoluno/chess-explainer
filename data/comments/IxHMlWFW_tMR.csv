Although Leko has never played the Marshall (8 c3 d5), he has had plenty of experience of the White side of Frank's gambit, so would be well aware of all the nuances in it, so Kasparov avoids it. It's not that he is frightened of the Marshall. It's just that, if Black doesn't go in for anything speculative, he has a safe draw.
