"The standard move 13...Nc4, or possibly 13...Rc4!, is probably better, unless my 22... Ne8 idea actually holds up.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting a better alternative move and questioning the viability of their own planned move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
"Nunn plays correctly, using the temporary threat of 19. Nxe7+ to set up 19. Bg7. The immediate 18.Bg7 was also tempting, but wouldn't have worked.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that Nunn made a mistake by opting for a less effective move (18.Bg7) instead of using a more powerful temporary threat (19.Nxe7+), which would have led to a stronger position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to g5"
"Ducking 19. Nxe7+, watching g1, and setting up ... Rab8, ... Qxb2+. This move is clearly the best try.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests an alternative, superior move in response to the error, demonstrating a better understanding of the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6"
"The key idea, as it is very hard to mate black without getting rid of his dark-squared bishop. Incidentally, I read a commentary by Ward (I think; it was a while ago) that he had expected the tempting 20. Nxe7+, which loses.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it discusses a hypothetical situation (20. Nxe7+) rather than addressing the specific move played or its consequences.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g7"
White's simple threat was 21.Bxh8 and 22.Nxe7. This move seems forced.,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a mistake by leaving a simple and forced move available to their opponent, which could have been prevented.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on g7"
"21...Kxg7 is a critical try, but it loses.",True,"

Yes, the comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates that the move 21...Kxg7 is considered a critical attempt that ultimately leads to a loss.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18.

"Black is invited to capture b2 on every move, but somewhat surprisingly there is no follow-up, while black's king is getting murdered in his bed. Furthermore, in some variations the capture helps white, as the queen is out of play and Rb1 becomes possible.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the potential and actual consequences of allowing the opponent to capture the b2 pawn, which leads to the weakening of the black king's position and opportunities for the white side.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7 21. Nxg7 Reb8 22. Nh5,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to h5"
"Here maybe I have a real improvement. The following analysis is definitely not exhaustive, but nonetheless after 22... Ne8, which is not mentioned by Nunn, I cannot find a win for white. Certainly it is logical to consider not exchanging knights, which changes the pawn-formation and solves white's possible congestion on the h-file. After the game move I am fairly certain that black is dead.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as they acknowledge a potential improvement and provide a logical analysis of the situation, indicating a mistake in the original move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7 21. Nxg7 Reb8 22. Nh5 Nxh5,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on h5"
The best try. Throwing in 23... Qxb2+ gives up control of g1.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by stating that the move ""Qxb2+"" relinquishes control of the g1 square, suggesting that the move was a blunder.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7 21. Nxg7 Reb8 22. Nh5 Nxh5 23. gxh5 Be8,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e8"
"Simply threatening 25. Nd5, to which there is no acceptable defense.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the lack of a viable defense against the proposed move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7 21. Nxg7 Reb8 22. Nh5 Nxh5 23. gxh5 Be8 24. b3,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Ward, Chris (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3"
The rest is just a formality.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it rather implies that the consequences of the mistake are inconsequential.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18. Qg5 Qb6 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Bg7 Bxg7 21. Nxg7 Reb8 22.

Last move played: White plays Knight takes on e7 with check"
"From the 14th move on, white apparently played perfectly in a complex tactical position. A terrific achievement.",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it praises the move made by white after the 14th move, which contradicts the premise of the question stating it was a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. g4 b5 14. h5 Nc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Bh6 Bh8 17. Nf5 Re8 18.
