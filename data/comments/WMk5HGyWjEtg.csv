"This is the ""Two Knights Variation."" It is an attempt to confuse the Caro-Kann player. Keene considers this ""sharp"" while Schiller calls it ""quiet."" How you handle it is a matter of personality. If you choose to give up the Bishop pair early you must keep the game ""closed."" (All four center pawns on the board.)

"Solid, but/ \. As a defender you must be aggressive. You also have the option to transpose into more familiar territory with 3/\.dxe4 4. Nxe4 5. Bf5. Also a tempting idea between moves 3 through 9 is the move /\d4. This is an attempt to close the center and gain space on the Queenside. Again this is a matter of personality. My favorite way of attacking the Two Knights Variation is to play 5/\Nf6 if 6. e5 then the center will be permanently locked giving you the chance to make your Knights better than the opponent's Bishops. You can choose between Nfd7 and Ne4. If White tries 6.d5 then 6/\dxe4. The idea is that Black gains a move (tempo) 7.Qe3 e6 (The d4 pawn is undefended if 7.Nxe4 Qxd4.).

"Here is the chance to create some interesting possibilities. For instance 6/\.d4 7. Ne2 Qb6. White is forced to commit to some sort of stand on the Queenside. One idea would be to play 8. c3. The problem with this idea is that Black is not developed properly. The ""total war"" that will develop is going to be difficult.",True," The comment identifies a potential weakness in Black’s development and suggests a risky plan, indicating a flawed strategic assessment.",1. e4 c6 2.

"While not objectiv ely unsound, 7/\.c5 invites many problems. Here the problem again is the lack of development. Typically in these pawn positions Black is going to want to play /\Bd6 and /\Nd7 before /\c5. Even stronger is if Black can also achieve a Rook on the c - file. Now consider the possibilities of 7/\. Nbd7 8. O-O-O Bd6. Now Black can try to ""clear and seal"" with /\c5 and /\d4. The concept involves clearing the Knight from it's defensive post and using the pawn structure to seal off the opponents pieces on the opposite side of the board. This takes courage because you will need to castle on the opposite side and attack without counting the cost (sacrifice almost everything if necessary). However, you do get to isolate the King away from any reinforcements.",True, The comment identifies a key flaw in Black's move – lack of development – and offers a potential strategic explanation for why it’s considered a mistake.,1. e4 c6 2.

"O-O-O Be7 The question for you to answer will be the pawn charge on the g - file. You might want to experiment with the Sicilian Dragon. After facing the Yugoslav Attack, you will loose the fear of these pawn charges. Even here you can play 9/\d4. A good rule is to always play in the center (e and d files). When you face an attack on the wing (side) become active in the center. Generally the stronger of the attacks will occur in the center.",True," The comment provides a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic consideration for the Sicilian Dragon.",1. e4 c6 2.

"16. Bc3? Afte r building a strong initiative, with a little help from your passive game, White plays a poor move. 16. Nxd4 cxd4 17. e5 Bc7 looks more interesting for White. With the d - file open and the Knight planted on d4 Black can easily equalize with 16/\e5. If 17. Bxd4 cxd5 gains a strong initiative for Black. Even 17. Nxd4 exd4 neuters the Bishop and gets you back into the game. With this exchange Black accomplishes several of White's major goals. (As much as possible, do not help your opponent. Never force your opponent to do something that you will regret!) First, Black opens the d - file White's only means of attack. Second Black opens the long diagonal (a1- h8) for White, in effect giving White the center. Finally, Black opens (abandons) the center. Once you post a Knight in your opponent's territory keep it there or make the opponent sacrifice (or pay a high price) to get rid of it. The reward for this is that White will seize the d - file and disrupt Black's ""key ranks"" (the 1,2,7,8 ranks) with the Bishops.",True,"

"Giving up the Bishop is a new concession that in effect looses the game. The Bishop was the only piece that was keeping the Black Rooks from invading your territory. One general idea is for the defender to trade off attacking pieces. However, that guideline is wrong in this situation. Principle: You must do what the position demands. Do not just follow general ideas or try to force your will on the position. You can still fight on after 24/\ Bf8. Bxe7 Rxe7 Bxc6 Qxc6 Rd6 Qc7 Rfd1 Kb8 R1d3 c4 R3d4 c3 b3 Rc8 A nating idea at this point is 31/\.Qa5. Black's move 31....Rc8 does not help. Rc4 Qa5 Rxc8+ Kxc8 Qa7 Qc7 Now for a review. Black allowed White to capture the d - file. This was complicated by giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding d6. Your weak points seem to be the lack of control of the central squares, lack of understanding pawn play, and (I suspect) the inability to understand the board position. Now for the good: somehow you managed to maintain your balance in a difficult position. You came up with a creative attacking idea (29/\.c4) when you needed it. With a solid understanding of the position and your creativity you will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus your game on the center. I'd suggest that you attack the center with simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the center) games. You may want to consider charting the pawn structures in your games. For instance, you may do better in positions without center pawns. I would suggest that you explore more aggressive openings - especially gambits. While you are charting your games give careful attention to when you make your errors. For instance in this game you could mark moves 16 and 24 as major errors. When you come up to your common problem moves, give yourself extra time to think through your move and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will bring fast improvement.
