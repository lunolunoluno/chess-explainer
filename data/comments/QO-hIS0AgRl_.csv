"I was sincerely surprised. Pirc-Ufimtsev Defense is not a usual one for Topalov, and this opening is hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category. White has too many opportunities for anybody's liking: one can lead an acute or a positional game, one can vary different ways of developing the initiative. Nevertheless, Topalov obviously counted on surprise, as he thought that I would play worse in a situation I was not ready for, and besides, he hoped to avoid my opening preparation, which he had faced before.",True," The comment suggests the opponent’s opening choice was unusual and potentially disadvantageous, highlighting a potential strategic misjudgment.",1. e4 d6,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garry (as White) and Topalov, Veselin (as Black).

"That was when I began to think. I was actually engrossed in thoughts on the third move, I had often played 3.f3 threatening with King's Indian Defense. However, this opening couldn't scare Topalov off as he was used to it, moreover, that was what he reckoned on. That is why I decided to play at sight.

"A strange move. Generally speaking, the move 7.Nge2 has no sense, its reason is purely psychological. I remembered that before the game, when we discussed the strategy with Yury Dokhoian, he said suddenly looking through Topalov's games: ""You know, Garry, he does not like when the opponent makes the moves he can not predict. This affects him strangely."" That is why I played 7.Nge2 and surprised Topalov. This move does not contain any threats but continues the development. However, it seemed to me that he did not like the character of the fight, as it did not correspond the ideas he had before the game.",True," The comment provides a potential psychological explanation for the mistake, suggesting the opponent's hesitation or dislike for unpredictable play.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

"The development of both sides is coming to its end. However, Black has to show some enterprise, as he is under some pressure. If White develops with g3, Bh3, and Rhe1, then it won't be easy for Black. Black's King is slightly weakened and, of course, he should have considered playing c6-c5, but then White would have a choice: close the position by playing d5, or even to exchange. It is probably more promising to close the center. White's space advantage lets him push for an attack. Then I hoped to make use of Black's weaknesses on the Queen-side. It was possible to move the Queen from h6 to b6 or to a7. This was an absurd thought: it flashed across my mind and immediately disappeared, but subconsciously I formed the idea that the Queen on b6 together with the Knight on a5 could make a lot of trouble, especially if the white Bishop appears on h3. This did affect the calculation of variations, but, the mere fact that such an idea surfaced served as a prologue to a wonderful combination.",True," The comment offers insightful analysis of a potential tactical error, suggesting a miscalculation based on a subconscious idea, indicating a significant flaw in the player's assessment.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.

"That was when I saw the possibility of a draw. Moreover, I felt that there was a possibility to continue the game, to play without the Rook, though I could not imagine what it would lead to. However, the image of the black King on a5 comforted my heart and intuition given to every man from birth, intuition of an ""attacker"" (let's call it that way), told me that there would be decision and a mate net around the black King would be spun in spite of the huge material advantage of the adversary. Besides, I was whipped up by curiosity of unexplored. Will there ever be another opportunity to lure out the black King into the center of my own camp!? In the long run, Lasker's ancient game [Lasker, Edward - Sir Thomas, George. London 1912.] with a sacrifice on h7 and King's move g8-g1 was like a myth to us.

"It is important that there is no checkmate on d1, because the white King suddenly goes to a2 and it turns out that the threat Qb3 can be also supported by the King from the a2-square. That is why the black Queen has to be on d5 (one has to understand this very important moment), in order to control the b3-square and to be able to play Qd4 if the white King is on b2.

"That was when I began to think. I was actually engrossed in thoughts on the third move, I had often played 3.f3 threatening with King's Indian Defense. However, this opening couldn't scare Topalov off as he was used to it, moreover, that was what he reckoned on. That is why I decided to play at sight. I went for a position I had a definite idea about but never met in practice and, frankly speaking, had never seriously analyzed.",True," The comment suggests a discrepancy in time, implying a potential flaw in the player's assessment of the position.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
