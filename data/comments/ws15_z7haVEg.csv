"This variation has a mixed reputation. On the one hand, Black concedes some space to White without much of a struggle, creating the pawn formation that Hans Kmoch would immortalize as the ""French Jump Formation."" On the other hand, Black's position resembles a brick: small, compact, hard to crack. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit fans are apt to play f3 here, counting on the materialistic nature of the average French player to make him munch the pawn.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it discusses the potential consequences of the move, highlighting the trade-off between space and positional advantage.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e4
"Najdorf just takes it off: he's interested in fluid development with a slight but pleasant spatial advantage without a material sacrifice. (4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3 Nf6 By transposition, then, we'd have the Euwe Defense to the BDG. The Euwe Defense has a pretty good theoretical reputation at present thanks to endorsements from GM Joe Gallagher and the Watson & Schiller analytical team. But it's not clear that this reputation is deserved since there are some improvements for White on the aforementioned analysis. In any event, what makes the 4.f3 line less attractive for White is the fact that Black can simply ignore it, like so: 4...e3 Now White has no open f-file, his f-pawn stunts his Kingside development, and the pawn formation is otherwise the same as he would get by just taking the pawn on e4.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the disadvantages of the move f3, such as weakening the king's side and creating an opportunity for Black to ignore the line and gain a spatial advantage.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on e4
"Partly because of the uncomfortable position of a Queen on f6, Black prepares the Knight exchange by playing Nbd7. Black would like to exchange off this strong N/e4, but the most natural way to do it can lead to trouble. 4...Nf6 Every time I give a simultaneous exhibition, I look to catch another victim in some version of the following age-old trap: 5.Nxf6+ Qxf6 6.Nf3 b6 7.Bd3 White weaves a nefarious web; Black plans a counter-blow. 7...Bb7 8.Bg5 Oh no! Is the Queen caught? 8...Bxf3 No she isn't! 9.Qd2 Yes she is!!! 9...Qxd4 No! 10.Bb5+ Yes!! Variants of this trap come up in many different openings. Whenever I teach the Colle System to a beginner, I make a point of illustrating how it can arise there -- and I have had more than one student come back and tell me tales of Queens netted like this!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential for a common trap in the position, indicating a lack of awareness from the opponent.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7
"Najdorf, imperturbably confident in his slight spatial and developmental edge, continues to bring out his pieces.",False,"

The comment focuses on the player's strategic position and confidence, which doesn't directly address the mistake made in the previous move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3
"How should we assess the position here? White's spatial advantage is worth the most when Black is cramped, with too many pieces on the board and too little space for maneuvering them. It makes good sense, therefore, for Black to swap off a pair of Knights. Makes sense -- but also takes time, and a single pair of Knights isn't all he'd like to get rid of. (6...Nxe4 7.Bxe4 Nf6 8.Bd3 After a tit-for-tat like this, Black is still left with a deficit in space and, importantly, a trapped B/c8.)",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic disadvantage Black faces due to the Knight exchange, leaving Black with a space deficit and a trapped bishop.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3
"Shapiro decides to defer the exchanges and concentrate on getting his Queenside untangled. To that end, he fianchettoes the B/c8.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player; it actually describes a strategic choice rather than a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7
What square does this move weaken? c6! Najdorf seizes the opportunity to take a peek at that square.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the specific square (c6) that the move weakens, which is a characteristic move of the Sicilian Defense (Najdorf variation).",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b6
"He's threatening Nc6 now, and if Black captures on e5, watch: 8...Nxe5 9.dxe5 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 The exchanges have opened up some space but now Black's pieces look badly-placed. 10...Qxd1 11.Rxd1 Rb8 12.Bc6+ Kf8 This is not a happy position for Black, despite the material equality. His pieces lack good squares and White is pretty obviously going to be coming down the d-file in the very near future. For example: 13.Be3 Bb7 14.Bxb7 Rxb7 15.Rd7 ...with Rad1 to come. White hasn't won material yet, but Black is being squeezed badly.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake, explains the consequences of the move, and outlines potential threats for the opponent, which demonstrates a good understanding of the position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e5
"Shapiro, reasonably enough, figures that there's nothing much to fuss about as long as he covers his c6 square.",True,"

The comment explains that the player, Shapiro, is not worried about the mistake because he has a defensive strategy to protect his c6 pawn square.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b7
"Najdorf, however, has a keener sense of the tactical usefulness of a N on e5. Black has three possible recaptures. Which one is best? 9...Nxf6 This is the most natural way to recapture -- yet it is precisely against this move that Najdorf's idea can be put into action. 10.Bb5+! Kf8 Because of the combined force of Bishop and Knight covering c6 and d7, Black is obliged to forfeit castling now.Perhaps you're thinking, ""So what? The King looks pretty safe on f8."" But the point is that in the long run Black's position will be even less coordinated than it is now -- he would have real difficulties getting his pieces into action. Already one of the difficulties he faces from being cramped, he should really want to avoid it -- whether or not there are immediate tactical consequences.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it analyzes the consequences of the move 9...Nxf6, suggesting that it could lead to a loss of coordination for Black's pieces and highlight the potential risks associated with this recapture.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f6 with check
"Despite the awkwardness of it, Shapiro should have taken with the Bishop. But he reasons thus: why not take with the pawn and get rid of that pesky N/e5 once and for all? Now if White backs up the Knight, Black can play f5, Nf6, Qd7 and 0-0-0 -- he might even be able to use the g-file for an attack on White's King later on. Even ugly moves can give victory if they are not met resolutely. Fortunately for us, resolute play is Najdorf's strong suit! Can you guess what he uncorks here?",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, noting the missed opportunity to capture the knight with the bishop, and highlighting the strategic possibilities that could have arisen from such a move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f6
Let your imagination run wild and you will see that Nxf7 has all the earmarks of an excellent investment. First point: it's an offer Black can't refuse.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it incorrectly praises the move as potentially good, while it is widely considered a blunder in chess.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f7
"Second point: White has at least a perpetual check now, since if nothing else he can keep going from g4-h5-g4+. Black can never set his King on a dark square or Bh6+ will be the end of him. For example: 11...Kg7 12.Bh6+ Kg8 13.Qg4+ Here's a delightful little line. 13...Kf7 14.Qg7+ Ke8 Now taking the Rook allows Black to play Nf8. Can you see a better idea? 15.Qg6+!! (15.Bg6+ hxg6 16.Qxg6#) 15...hxg6 16.Bxg6# Same effect, but a little more glamourous this way.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential for perpetual check and the endgame possibility for White.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h5 with check
"All of that demonstrates why Black must not put his King on a dark square. So we know, already, that White has at least a perpetual check in hand any time he wants it.Najdorf, of course, wants a good deal more than that. Now it's a sad but true fact that with the material aimed at the King right now, White cannot deliver checkmate. How can he best get another heavy piece into action? It will take a few moves to get a rook into action. Nevertheless, Najdorf starts the process.",True,"

The comment acknowledges the mistake made by Black and correctly explains the consequences of the move, indicating that it was a poor decision.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to g8
"Shapiro hunkers down to defend. Najdorf decides he'd like more open diagonals, thank-you-very-much.",True,"

The comment accurately describes a situation where a player (Shapiro) made a defensive move, while another player (Najdorf) wanted more open diagonals, suggesting a mistake in Shapiro's play.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f8
"And yes, he'd like fries with that. Crispy french-fried Black pieces, please!",True,"

The comment humorously implies that the player made a mistake, as ""Black pieces"" represent the dark-colored chess pieces played by the opponent, suggesting an unfavorable move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on e6
The gift cannot be refused. But now White's lightsquare Bishop becomes a brilliant laser pinning down the Knight on the e-file.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights a significant tactical opportunity missed by White to exploit their lightsquare Bishop to control key squares and apply pressure on Black's Knight.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e6
"Najdorf tightens the screws mercilessly. How can the Knight be defended? White has a grip on d5 thanks to his Queen's control of the fifth rank, so ...Bd5 is out of the question. That leaves only Bc8.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the pressure on the Knight and the inability to defend it due to White's control of the d5 square.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6 14. Bc4 Qd6 15. Bh6 Bf8 16. Re1,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1
Now Black's pieces are so awkwardly pinned and stuck together that it's almost a miracle he's not mated already. Najdorf gleefully adds another pin to the mix.,True,"

The comment accurately describes a strategic oversight by the Black player, resulting in their pieces being pinned and positioned in such a way that they are at risk of being captured or losing material.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6 14. Bc4 Qd6 15. Bh6 Bf8 16. Re1 Bc8,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c8
But now the threat is just Rxe6!! e.g. 17...a5 18.Rxe6 Bxe6 19.Qxe6+ Another nice little touch. This game is for the Bishops in our audience... 19...Qxe6 20.Bxe6#. I can well imagine that Shapiro was getting desperate hereabouts.,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player as it highlights the missed opportunity for a quick checkmate by the opponent's knight.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5.

Qe8,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e8
"He offered to shed an entire Rook to relieve the immediate pressure. Najdorf, however, knows what to do with an open line.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the player's offer to exchange a Rook for a minor piece (likely a Knight or Bishop) was a risky move, considering Najdorf's expertise in exploiting open lines.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6 14. Bc4 Qd6 15. Bh6 Bf8 16. Re1 Bc8 17. Qe8 Bd7,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d7
This stunning sacrifice brings down the house.,False,"

The comment seems to praise the move as a sacrifice, not acknowledging its mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10.

Last move played: White plays Rook takes on e6
Discovered check!,True,"

The comment ""Discovered check!"" indicates that the player's mistake led to an unanticipated threat where the opponent's last move revealed a check they couldn't have seen before.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6 14. Bc4 Qd6 15. Bh6 Bf8 16. Re1 Bc8 17. Qe8 Bd7 18. Rxe6 Rxe8 19. Rxe8+,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on e8 with check
Some form of interposition is forced.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake as a lack of interposition, which is essential for maintaining the structure and connectivity of the pieces in chess.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O b6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nxf6+ gxf6 10. Nxf7 Kxf7 11. Qh5+ Kg8 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Rxe6 Nxe6 14. Bc4 Qd6 15. Bh6 Bf8 16. Re1 Bc8 17. Qe8 Bd7 18. Rxe6 Rxe8 19. Rxe8+ Be6,This is a game between Najdorf (as White) and Shapiro (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6
"The final mating position is reminiscent of the ""Opera Box Game"" Morphy v. Allies. Note, in particular, that the mate is carried out with White's two remaining pieces, and that throughout the whole of this brevity Najdorf has wasted not a single move on wing pawns. This is imaginative play of a very high order!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, but rather praises the quality of the move and compares it to a famous chess game.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5.
