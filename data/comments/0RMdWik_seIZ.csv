"Bogoljubov was considered a very good expert of the Slave Defense. He had proved that the year before (1929) during his match against Alekhine. But Mikenas did not care about that. He had studied openings very carefully, and the strategic ideas and right in the Slave he had a novelty. Was not this a good opportunity to test it?",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses more on the background and previous performance of the player Bogoljubov rather than the specific error in the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.

"Perhaps the strongest reply against Black's choice. Now 11.Nxc4 is threatened, and if 10... Bxc5 11.Qxc4 the threat is 12.e4.",True,"

"This move seriously weakens the e6 Pawn, and this will strenghten the pressure of White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move made by the player has weakened the pawn structure at e6, and it also correctly identifies that this will increase the pressure on White.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.
