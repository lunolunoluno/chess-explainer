Its always very tempting to set up raking Bishops like this. Here Black is coerced into playing his Rook to an awkward square to avoid White breaching the Black Kingside defences by Bxd7 followed by Bxf6.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the aggressive intent of the White bishop, forcing the Black rook to an unfavorable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4.

"White wants to bring the Rook down from e4, where it blocks the diagonal of the Bishop on d3, and is also exposed to attack. But on e4 the Rook keeps an important eye on h4, preventing the Knight from going there.
