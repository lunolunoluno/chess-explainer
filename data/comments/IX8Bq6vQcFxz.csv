"Is there much purpose to such a move or is he simply giving Ivanchuk something to think about, considering alternatives he might not have thought about during his pre-game preparations. Sometimes giving a person alternatives lets them go astray of their own accord.",True," The comment suggests the move lacks strategic depth and could be a result of the opponent's anticipation, indicating a potential weakness in the playerâ€™s planning.",1. d4 d5 2.

"Since Pd5 will oppose White's Bf1 White will probably try c2-c4, but Black could still support Pd5 with ...c7-c6 (and Anand has played the Semi-Slav Defense) .",True," The comment suggests a potential tactical weakness and a possible response from Black, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. d4 d5 2.

"This is an attempt to show White hasn't put enough pressure on the center or developed quickly enough to avoid simplification. I wouldn't say this is a sharp attempt by Black to play for a win, though it is conceivable one would still win with the Black pieces.

Black is steadfastly holding onto the pawn.

"The mix of pieces is unusual and that complicates the task of both players. I wonder who offered the draw. I also find it interesting that Ivanchuk didn't make any headway against Ponomariov's Queen's Gambit Accepted or against Anand with the Catalan, where the basic idea of Black threatening to take and hold onto Pc4 is primary and for Black to play strongly with his pieces while Bg2 is (at least temporarily) blocked by Nf3 seems to give Black easy equality.",True," The comment offers a detailed analysis of the move's impact, suggesting a strategic flaw and potential draw, indicating a significant mistake.",1. d4 d5 2.
