"It was only here that I looked up the theory and learned that 12.Nxf7 was a move... it seemed more interesting than any of the alternatives so I just played it. I figured that since Svidler had played it once against Anand it couldn't be too bad, so I would just go where the currents took me and figure things out as I went. It turned out that this led to a very interesting struggle.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake as they were not familiar with the theory behind the move 12.Nxf7, instead choosing to follow the ""currents"" without prior knowledge, leading to an interesting but unexpected outcome.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f7," ""In this move, White chose 12.Nxf7, which is less effective compared to other options. They selected it because they assumed, based on Svidler's previous use against Anand, that it was a viable choice. They let the position guide them and adapted as the game progressed. However, it led to a challenging situation."""
"Before I played this I had got around to studying the position myself and I decided I liked this move better than Svidler's approach. 14.Ne4 is natural; it clears the way for the c1-bishop, the f-pawn, and it has some less obvious points as well.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it simply states the player's personal preference for a move without addressing the potential errors in the previous move.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Since the c1-bishop is unleashed black cannot meet 16. Qg4+ anymore with 16...Ke7. Therefore, the main threat is Qg4+, Qf5+, and e5-e6, when there is a mate threat to f7 and the bishop on d5 suddenly hangs. Black's move 15...Ne7 seems like the only way to meet this threat tactically, but since it involves backing up, burying the f8-bishop and leaving the king in the center, I ought to have good compensation for the piece.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, emphasizing the loss of the c1-bishop's defensive support for the king and highlighting the tactical threats Black can exploit.",1. e4 e5 2.

Qxe4,This is a game between echecetmat (as White) and W R Horton (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on e4," White's move of Qg4+ left Black in a difficult position. With Black's Ne7, they are trying to address the threats of Qf5+ and e5-e6, but this move also involves moving the f8-bishop back, compromising their pawn structure, and centralizing their king, which weakens their position."
"This is an important intermezzo that might not be so easy to spot over the board. I didn't see what would happen but I saw that I had to play it or else I would lose my compensation for the piece, so I was still flowing with the current...",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it merely provides a possible justification for the move, without directly addressing why it was a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

"19.f4 immediately might be possible, but it seemed obvious to play this first. The tactical idea is just that if black leaves the diagonal then Qf3+ picks up a rook. c6 is apparently a worse square for the queen because she is actually well-placed in a centralised position; for example f4-f5 is met by just ...Qxe5. However in the game there is another important consideration that comes out; from c6 the queen makes a defense possible with ...Ng6, so 19.c4 may have actually helped black.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential tactical opportunity for Black with Qf3+ and the misplaced consideration of the queen's position by White, which ultimately led to an ineffective defensive move with 19.c4.",1. e4 e5 2.

Qg4+ Kf7 18. axb3 Qd5 19. c4,This is a game between echecetmat (as White) and W R Horton (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4," 19.f4 is a move that might seem viable, but in this situation, it was better to opt for a different approach. The plan was to maneuver the queen to Qf3+, capturing a rook, assuming Black leaves the diagonal open. However, this move neglects Black's potential response with...Ng6, which would create a defensive opportunity for Black. The suggestion to play 19.c4 could have actually been more advantageous for Black, as it would have supported the knight on g6, fortifying the defense."
Playing this before ...Qc6 avoids cxb5.,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as playing...Qc6 would indeed leave the pawn on b5 en prise, allowing the opponent to capture it after cxb5.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on c4, 'Playing this before...Qc6 avoids the risk of losing the taken pawn.'
Frankly this was the only move I considered since it seemed positionally sound to push the passers ahead. Black has some serious problems to unravel before I play f5-f6 or else he will be losing ... frankly I didn't see how he could do it. If I had appreciated the strength of ...Ng6 then I might have considered grabbing another pawn here with 21.Qxd4.,True,"

The comment explains that the player missed the opportunity to attack the knight on g6, which was a mistake in the game.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4," The move 21.Qxd4 was not optimal because Black had significant issues to address. The position of Black's knight was a key factor that wasn't fully appreciated, and without addressing it properly, White's plan to advance with f5-f6 would likely result in Black's advantage. The decision to capture on d4 might have been reconsidered if the potential threats from...Ng6 had been fully evaluated."
Black has a well thought out defense. This move gains a tempo because of my 24th move.,False,"

The comment does not adequately explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on the opponent's defense rather than addressing the specific error in the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

"Nice, intending to meet f4-f5 with ...Nxe5. Qf5+ seems like it ought to be disruptive but it doesn't do anything and gets in the way of my pawns.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, explaining how the move Qf5+ fails to have a disruptive impact on the opponent's position and hinders the player's own pawns.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to g6," They may have intended to advance their knight to e5, but their queen's move to f5 was unnecessary and obstructed their pawn alignment."
"During the game I was more worried about how to get compensation after 24...Be7, and probably justifiably. Although 24...Bc5 seems logical, it is probably a mistake if black cannot find any improvements on the game and 38.Rf5 is as strong as it appears.",True,"

The comment accurately reflects that 24...Bc5 is likely a mistake as it doesn't improve the position, and the opponent's potential play of 38.Rf5 could be strong.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5," White played flawlessly, but Black might have misjudged by playing Bishop to c5. This move, while seemingly logical, could be a mistake if Black cannot improve their position. The game could tighten up if White executes 38.Rf5, which appears very strong."
"It was only in this position that I finally found some tactical ways to get back the material... I was ecstatic, surely this must mean I am winning? If I can get back material, and retain my attack?! 30.Qd3 is not the most obviously agressive move but it threatens f5-f6 and Qg6, and stops defenses based on d4-d3+.",True,"

Opening the a2-g8 diagonal with tempo.,True,"
