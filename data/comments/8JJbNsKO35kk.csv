"White has a big choice, but the system chosen by Ponomariov has been popular for a few years now. It was invented by the American GM Robert Byrne and popularized (as the English Attack) during the 1980s by English GMs Nigel Short and John Nunn. Nowadays all the top players (who play 1. e4) use it.",True," The comment offers context about the history and popularity of the system, potentially explaining why the move was considered a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This forced simplification lead to approximate equality. White's rook is better than Rb5 and Kg8 is a little cramped, but not terribly so.

"a courageous thing to do against Kasparov, but maybe he felt pushed into it because Black could yet create a passed pawn by using ...f7-f6xg5.
