"Imagine that your computer needs repair. You get your Acme Handy Dandy Computer Repair Tool Kit out and start to repair the beast. What do you have to do first? Answer: Open the kit so you can get the tools out. You can hit the computer with the tool kit all you want, but it won't fix the computer. You must get the tools out of the kit. Chess is the same way. If you want to crush your opponent, you must open the game so you can get your tools (pieces) into position where they are useful. Moving the Queen's Bishop to e3 blocks the potential development of the King's Bishop.",True," The comment provides a relatable analogy to illustrate a strategic error, suggesting a need for preparation.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. d3 d6 4. Be3 Be6,This is a game between W30 (as White) and B30 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6,The position is equal,5. Bf4 Bg4 ,4... e5 5. Bg5 
"Idea: Do not move a piece a second time in the opening without a specific reason. It is almost always a bad idea. The problem with moving a piece a second time is that wastes time. Let's say you have only 15 minutes to fix your computer and you take 14 minutes to get the Acme Handy Dandy Computer Repair Tool Kit out. Remember to make the most efficient use of your TIME and moves. Second idea: count the number of squares the Knight can move to on f3 (eight), now count the number of squares it can move to on h4 (four). Because FLEXIBILITY is important, remember, ""A Knight on the rim is dim [or grim]."" Imagine a really ugly Y2K bug creeping out of the shadows and snatching a Knight you put on the edge of the board.",True," The comment provides a rationale for avoiding repeated piece moves, suggesting a strategic error.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. d3 d6 4. Be3 Be6 5. Nh4 Na5,This is a game between W30 (as White) and B30 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a5,The position is equal,6. b4 ,5... d5 6. d4 
"Here you had to move the Queen's Bishop again, if you had put it here on move 4. you would have had a spare move to make. It's like taking an extra turn. [Ever wish you could take more than one turn at a time? Here is where you can do it, legally! By playing 4. Bf4 you could now play anything else on move 6.] BTW, your opponent helps by mindlessly copying your moves.",True," The comment offers constructive criticism about a missed opportunity and suggests a possible alternative, indicating a potential understanding of the mistake.",1.

Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d5,Large advantage for White (eval: 120 centipawns),7. e4 ,6... c5 7. e4 
"7. e4 takes up more space in the center. Concentrate your opening moves on the four squares in the center of the board. If your video card needs to be replaced why try to change your hard drive? Important Idea: BEFORE YOU MOVE: Ask yourself, ""What is my opponent threatening?"" Answer: 8.... g5 [forking your Bishop and Knight].",True," The comment suggests the opponent’s threat, but it doesn’t directly address the tactical error of the move, making it a weak assessment.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. d3 d6 4. Be3 Be6 5. Nh4 Na5 6. Bf4 Bd5 7. e3 h6,This is a game between W30 (as White) and B30 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6,Advantage for White (eval: 60 centipawns),8. Nxd5 ,7... c5 8. d4 
"There are three ways to deal with a threat: First, move the piece that is threatened. Second, capture the piece that is attacking [in this case 9. Nxg2 wins the Bishop]. Or finally, ignore the threat and attack something. This works when your threat is stronger than your opponents' threat.",True," The comment offers potential solutions to a threat, but it doesn't accurately diagnose the error, suggesting a misunderstanding of strategic principles.",1.
