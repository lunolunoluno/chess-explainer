"A blasphemy for a normal player of the time. Since the quick development of the white pieces is interrupted by the king in the centre, Black should be automatically better. But Steinitz noted that long-term factors could override temporary inconvenience. The white minor pieces will gain extra tempi attacking Black's queen. White's better control of the centre will help him to organize future attacks and also to prevent Black's pieces from harmonious development. As it later turned out Steinitz' Gambit was proven to be not very dangerous for Black, but only as a result of precise and very dynamic play. Not surprisingly Steinitz' opponents, who weren't ready to take this ugly opening seriously, couldn't resist testing his revolutionary strategy.",True,"
The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the potential advantages for White in the long-term, despite a seemingly poorer position, due to better control of the center and the potential for dynamic play.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Would you believe that the white king has already made six moves. But the outcome of the game is clear. The disconnected black army has nothing to counter the widespreading white attack,",True,"

"This pawn sacrifice opens up the lines around the opponent's king, a manoeuvre that became typical for the games in our century.",False,"

Desperately trying to make use of his queen. Other moves fail to change anything:,True,"
