Nimzowitsch's forgotten idea for conducting this opening was revived by Portisch (as Black) in his game with Andersson from Palma 1971.,False,"

The comment provides historical context about Portisch's approach with Black in a specific game, but it does not explain the mistake made by the player in the move being evaluated.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5,"This is a game between Kmoch, Hans (as White) and Nimzowitsch, A. (as Black).

"An interesting position. Black's normal strategy would be to storm forwards on the King side with his mobile pawns, but the fact that White's KP is on e2 rather then e4 makes it more difficult for Black to fix on a target. White's normal plan would be to launch a Queen side advance with b2-b4, c4-c5 etc. breaking into Black's camp at the sensitive point c7. However, the absence of White's KP from e4 also exerts an influence over White's plan of campaign in that (after c4-c5) is QP will be deprived of much of his support. In such strategically complex position Numzowitsch excelled. Now many of his original ideas have been absorbed into master tecnique or incorporated into ""openings theory"".",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the typical strategic plan for Black and how the absence of White's King Pawn on e4 influences Black's approach, as well as how White should adapt their plan due to the missing pawn.",1.

A useful consolidating move directed against the mobility of Black's KP and KBP. 14...,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests a move that aims to restrict the movement of Black's King and Bishop, which indicates that the player was trying to create a disadvantageous situation for Black.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5 e5 10. Be3 f5 11. Ne1 Bxg2 12. Nxg2 d6 13.

"Provocation. Also possible was the more solipstic procedure Rf7,Qf8 followed by h7-h6 and g6-g5. But Nimzowitsch prefers to encourage activity from his opponent since he correctly perceives that this very activity will ultimately be White's undoing.",True,"

The comment provides a clear analysis of the mistake, suggesting alternative moves that could have been more strategic and referencing Nimzowitsch to explain why the active play by the opponent will lead to the player's downfall.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5 e5 10. Be3 f5 11. Ne1 Bxg2 12. Nxg2 d6 13. Qd2 Nd7 14. f3 a5 15.

And prophylaxis! Observe the way in which Nimzowitsch guards the c7 point before it is attacked.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, highlighting the prophylactic nature of Nimzowitsch's guarding of the c7 point, thus demonstrating a strategic foresight missed by the opponent.",1.

A device for gaining space on the King side which is now regulation in the King's Indian Defence. Given time Black will also play g6-g5 with an awesome array of pawns.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the move might have been a miscalculation and lacked consideration of Black's potential counterplay, specifically the pawn push to g6-g5 in the King's Indian Defence.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5 e5 10. Be3 f5 11. Ne1 Bxg2 12. Nxg2 d6 13. Qd2 Nd7 14. f3 a5 15. Rab1 Nc5 16. b3 Rf7 17. a3 Qf8 18.

"This temporary sacrifice of a pawn looks most promising since it exposes a number of weaknesses in the Black position. However, with this move White is walking straight into a combinative ambush; it could be said that he started out on the ambush trail when he was lured into a Queen side advance (with gain of tempo) by 15...Nc5, but what other choice did White have? Black holds the initiative on the King wing so the only alternative to Queen side activity would be passive defence. Attractive though its execution might appear Nimzowitsch had prepared so efficiently for the possibility of a White Queen side advance that the whole plan of carrying it through could be classed as a collective error.",True,"

This comment thoroughly explains the mistake made by the player, as it provides a detailed analysis of the consequences of the move, referring to the potential weaknesses and the overall strategic misstep.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5 e5 10. Be3 f5 11. Ne1 Bxg2 12. Nxg2 d6 13. Qd2 Nd7 14. f3 a5 15. Rab1 Nc5 16. b3 Rf7 17. a3 Qf8 18.

White has had to weaken his dark squares in order to shatter Black's pawns.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it provides a general strategy rather than indicating a specific error in the move played.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. d4 Ne4 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. d5 e5 10. Be3 f5 11. Ne1 Bxg2 12. Nxg2 d6 13. Qd2 Nd7 14. f3 a5 15. Rab1 Nc5 16. b3 Rf7 17. a3 Qf8 18.

"""White seems to be in the ascendant but Black has not been marking time. In fact he has been engaged in the accumulation of attacking energy (QR file, h6-d2 diagonal, mobile pawn mass, etc.) and now emerges with a series of noxious blows which had completely escaped White's attention. We might add, by the way, that without Black's cooperation (the partly superfluous and partly provocatory Nc5) White would scarcely ever have been able to arrange his break-through with pawn-c5. (Nimzowitsch)",True,"

The comment explains that White overlooked Black's accumulating attacking energy, leading to a decisive breakthrough with pawn-c5, as described by Nimzowitsch.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4.

The ambush is spung and events now develop by force. This counter-sacrifice has the effect of galvanising Black's entire army which had hitherto slumbered peacefully within the confines of the back two ranks.,False,"

The comment does not accurately describe the mistake made by the player, as it seems to praise the move rather than criticize it.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6.

"The final point of the cpmbination. Black wins a pawn and bares the white King. It was also possible to play 31...Bf8, retaining the Bishop for attacking purposes, when White could hardly resist successfully, so disorganised are his lines of defence (backward KP, straying QP, exposed KBP and unsheltered K).",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the consequences of the move (Black winning a pawn and exposing the White King) and suggesting an alternative move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 g6 4.

"An extra pawn plus the more secure position should amount to a verdict of -+, but...",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the apparent contradiction between gaining a material advantage and achieving a better position, suggesting that the move was actually a good one despite being evaluated as a mistake.",1.

Nimzowitsch admitted quite frankly in his notes that he had forgotten that this move was legal! White's counter-attack against Black's KBP and KRP forces Nimzowitsch to start all over again. 38...,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the illegality of the move and the subsequent need for a new strategy against Black's pieces.",1.
