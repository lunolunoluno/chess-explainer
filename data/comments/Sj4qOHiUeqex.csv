"As a coach of children, I teach them insanely aggressive openings up until they are over the 1500 mark. From 1500 - 1800 they learn the Colle - K. It's good for handling better opponents with explosive possibilities. After 1800 I require them to play the Torre and introduce them to the Queen's Gambit. The Colle introduces the player to games that are ""close"" (less given to the luck that the opponent will miss something). In other words, creating advantages from equal positions. Also it stretches them to understand the position and play accordingly.",True," The comment suggests a flawed opening strategy that prioritizes aggressive tactics over solid positional understanding, potentially hindering a player’s long-term growth.",1. d4 Nf6 2.
