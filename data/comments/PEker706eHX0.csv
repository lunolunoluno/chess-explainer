"Safe enough. If White now takes the e-pawn, the game might go on thus: 5.fxe5 dxe5 6.Nxe5 Qd4 7.Nd3 Bb6, etc.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential consequences of the move, indicating that it is not a safe play due to the threats it poses.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
"This move was played by Anderssen against Blackburne in the Vienna tourney, whereupon the latter also replied 7.a3.",True,"

The comment provides historical context and details about the specific moves, helping to understand the mistake made by the player against the opponent's response.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"
"Stronger than 7.a3, and it seems, from the progress of the present game, that the array of White's pawns on the kingside cannot be broken through.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it does not specify what move was made or what the consequences of the move were.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f5"
"The answer either 7...g6 or 7...Na5 would have been 8.a3; for in the former case, if Black proceeded by 8...gxf5, White would reply 9.Bg5, threatening knight to d5, and in the latter case Black could only follow up by taking the bishop, and on the pawn retaking he would have had little prospect of liberating his game on either side.",True,"

The comment provides a thorough explanation of why the move was a mistake, as it outlines alternative, better options for the player and details the consequences of the move played.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
"In order to fortify the attack immediately by pawn to g4, in case Black attempted to castle on the kingside, or to open the game by pawn to g6, as afterwards done.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to suggest potential moves instead of addressing a specific error.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"
"White, being safe on both wings, makes an opening for his bishop to prevent the opponent exchanging it by knight to a5. He has now also prepared for an attack with his pawns, on either side, wherever the adversary might attempt to castle, while his own king is in perfect security.",False,"

The comment does not explain a mistake made by the player; it actually describes a potentially good move that secures the king and prepares for an attack.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
[?:??-1:00],True,"

The comment indicates that the player made a critical mistake, given the time spent (00 minutes) to evaluate the situation.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b8"
[1:00-?:??],True,"

The comment ""[1:00-?:??]"" suggests that the move taken by the player was a significant blunder, possibly resulting in a major material loss or positional disadvantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20. Qe2,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"
"White threatens now to take possession of the open g-file with both rooks by rook to g1, followed by rook to a2.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the potential consequences of the player's move, highlighting the threat to the g-file and the subsequent capture of the opponent's pieces.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20. Qe2 Qg7 21. Be3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"
"22...Rh3 would not have improved Black's position, for the opponent would have first answered 23.Ke2 before attacking the queen.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake, as the move 22...Rh3 would have been ineffective due to the potential immediate countermove 23.Ke2 by White, which would have threatened the queen and provided White with a significant advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20. Qe2 Qg7 21. Be3 Bxe3 22. Qxe3 Qh6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h6"
"24...Rh7 was the only other means to prevent the hostile rook cutting off the king by rook to g7, and then the game might have proceeded thus: 24...Rh7 25.Rg8+ Ke7 26.axb5 axb5 27.Ra7 Nc6 28. Rxb8, winning a piece.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the potential continuation of the game after 24...Rh7, which could have led to White winning a piece.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20. Qe2 Qg7 21.

"Better now than checking with the rook, whereupon Black might have attacked the rook by 26...Kf8, and White could not then capture the c-pawn on account of the impending rook to h1, check.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the potential threats Black could have used to attack and trap the White rook, thus preventing the capture of the c-pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20.

Last move played: White plays King to f2"
"[?:??-2:00]; White threatened pawn to d6, check, winning a piece. Neither pawn takes pawn nor rook to h5 would have been a better resource, for in the former case White could have replied 28.Bc4 without altering the position materially, and in the latter contingency he could move out of all danger by 28.Ke3, followed in answer to 28...Rxf5, by 29. Nh4, threatening check at g6, and winning at least the exchange.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it outlines why the move wasn't strong and suggests alternative options that could have been more favorable for the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to f8"
"The pawn could not be retaken, on account of 29.Ra7, winning easily.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because the pawn was indeed lost by retaking it with the rook after 29.Ra7.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20. Qe2 Qg7 21. Be3 Bxe3 22.

Last move played: Black plays King to d6"
"Had he played 32...Ke7, White would have pushed 33.d6+, followed by 34.Bxf7, etc.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it suggests a better sequence of moves that would have put White in a challenging position, indicating that the player's move was suboptimal.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. d3 a6 7. f5 h6 8. h3 Qe7 9. a3 b5 10. Nd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bb7 12. b4 Bb6 13. a4 Rb8 14. c3 Nd8 15. Bb3 g6 16. g4 h5 17. Rf1 hxg4 18. hxg4 gxf5 19. gxf5 f6 20.

"A last desperate attempt to prolong the game by 36...c6, in case White takes off the bishop at once; but White's reply leaves no escape.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it lacks specific details about the board position or the inaccuracy of the move 36...c6.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5.
