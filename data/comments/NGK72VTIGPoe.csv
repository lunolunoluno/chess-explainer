"Not a particularly effective move in this line.

"A tremendously insightful move! Capablanca sees that he must turn his weak pawns into fighting pieces, and the idea is to play Na5 then b5-b4 which will constrict the White queenside.

The threat of b5-b4 is renewed. Keep this position in mind as we continue. It is in stark contrast to the position we will see in seven more moves.

Black's play requires no comment Capablanca saw that White's pieces were out of play and simply switched sides of the board.
