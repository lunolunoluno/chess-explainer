"A very bad move. In the opening stages of the game, do NOT move a piece twice without first developing your other pieces, except to prevent loss of material. In the beginning, there are 3 elements that are very important: 1) Development -- getting pieces out of their home squares 2) Center control, and 3) space. Black should've staked some central control by playing either ...c5 or ...e5.",True," The comment offers crucial advice on piece development, centering, and strategic planning, directly addressing the identified mistake.",1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3.

"VERY bad. Black needs open lines for his pieces, including . ...c5! is the natural way to do that, followed by ..Nc6, ...Rc8, and mabe ...cxd4. This would also weaken white's protection of his e5 pawn once the d4 pawn falls. The general principle is: Attack the base of pawn chains. For white, this is e6, and for black it is d4.

"Black should've avoided weakening his king position. Again, ..Na5 and ...c5 was mandatory.
