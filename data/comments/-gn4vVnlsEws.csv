1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7,"A very bad move. In the opening stages of the game, do NOT move a piece
twice without first developing your other pieces, except to prevent loss of
material. In the beginning, there are 3 elements that are very important: 1)
Development -- getting pieces out of their home squares 2) Center control, and
3) space. Black should've staked some central control by playing either ...c5
or ...e5.",True
1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7 4. Be3 e6 5. Nf3,"Because of black's particularly passive play,
there's no reason white should not do 5. f4! right away to gain more SPACE and
central control (e5 square). Notice white plays f4 later anyways, albeit after
a lot of maneuvering.",True

reason for this move. Simply 8. d4, staking claim in the center and opening up
the f1-a6 diagonal for the white's light-squared bishop is more logical.",True

fighting chance.",True

yourself a free hand on the king-side.",True

open lines for his pieces, including . ...c5! is the natural way to do that,
followed by ..Nc6, ...Rc8, and mabe ...cxd4. This would also weaken white's
protection of his e5 pawn once the d4 pawn falls. The general principle is:
Attack the base of pawn chains. For white, this is e6, and for black it is d4.
Note that eventually, White indeed does attack the base of black's pawn chain,
which was black's fatal error.",True

his king position. Again, ..Na5 and ...c5 was mandatory. White could've taken
advantage of this mistake by playing 13. g4!, followed by h5, Rg1, and g5
opening up lines on black's king side immediately.",True
