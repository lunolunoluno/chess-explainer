1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7,"A very bad move. In the opening stages of the game, do NOT move a piece
twice without first developing your other pieces, except to prevent loss of
material. In the beginning, there are 3 elements that are very important: 1)
Development -- getting pieces out of their home squares 2) Center control, and
3) space. Black should've staked some central control by playing either ...c5
or ...e5."
1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7 4. Be3 e6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. Qe2 b6 7. O-O-O Bb7 8. Kb1,"There isn't a good
reason for this move. Simply 8. d4, staking claim in the center and opening up
the f1-a6 diagonal for the white's light-squared bishop is more logical."
1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7 4. Be3 e6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. Qe2 b6 7. O-O-O Bb7 8. Kb1 a6,"Again, black needs to control the center. ...c5! and Nc6! would give black a
fighting chance."

his king position. Again, ..Na5 and ...c5 was mandatory. White could've taken
advantage of this mistake by playing 13. g4!, followed by h5, Rg1, and g5
opening up lines on black's king side immediately."

threat, white can play g4! with a strong attack. For example, if 15. ... Bxh4
16. Nf3 Be7 17. g5, and white opens the h-file to fatal effect, because of
mate threats involving Qh2. And if black declines white's pawn, white can
simply play g5, opening up black's king side."

. c5 19. Ne2 Bxd2 20. Rxd2 c4 21. bxc4 Nxc4 22. Bxc4 (forced because of the ...
Qb5+, Ka1, Qb2 mate threat) dxc4 23. Qf1 Bxh1 would leave black with a winning
position!"

is 28. g7+ Kg8 29. Qh5, with the idea of Qxh6 and Qh8 checkmate."
