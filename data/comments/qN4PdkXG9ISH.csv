"Very ambitious. On the one hand 5.a3 is a free move for white, but black is going to sack a pawn and try to demonstrate that 4.f3 weakened white's king.",True," The comment suggests a potential tactical threat and a strategic plan, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3.

"This is probably the best way to grab a pawn. I think it is very revealing to see the ways 9.exd5 and 9.Nxd5 get punished. Then one realizes that, assuming he had seen black's idea, he probably would have played it too.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a flawed strategic assessment.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3.

"I'm not sure exactly why Shirov didn't play 16.Rb1. Did he understand that it was an objectively bad move, see some deep tactical refutation, or just prefer to return material over passive defense. It seems clear that black gets prolonged play for the piece, but I don't see how he can convert it to something before the material tells. Another issue is that white's position could be very fun to play after 16.Qe4.",True," The comment raises a complex question about tactical calculation and positional evaluation, suggesting a potential misjudgment of the inherent value of the move.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3.

"This move really ""made the game"" for me. There's something about the wide open space around white's centralized monarch that makes it seem odd that white is the one attacking the opponent's king. Thus, the sheer audacity of the move is immediately compelling. Unfortunately the logical reasons for the move are not so easy to explain without getting into detailed variations, but I find this is often the case with Shirov's games; rarely could he be accused of playing transparently!",True," The comment expresses a subjective opinion about the move's impact, suggesting a perceived benefit, which contradicts the evaluation of it as a mistake.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3.
