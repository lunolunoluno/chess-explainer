"Very ambitious. On the one hand 5.a3 is a free move for white, but black is going to sack a pawn and try to demonstrate that 4.f3 weakened white's king.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the potential aggressive response from Black, indicating that White's move 4.f3 may weaken the king's position, allowing Black to exploit the situation.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Eingorn, Viacheslav (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"
"This is probably the best way to grab a pawn. I think it is very revealing to see the ways 9.exd5 and 9.Nxd5 get punished. Then one realizes that, assuming he had seen black's idea, he probably would have played it too.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential downfall of the move and showing that the player may have been unaware of the better alternative.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Eingorn, Viacheslav (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"
"The pawn becomes a piece as black struggles to keep the initiative. However, 14...Rd8 is very dangerous and could have easily won the game against inferior defense.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as 14...Rd8 puts the black rook in a vulnerable position that could have led to a decisive advantage against a weak defense.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13.

"I'm not sure exactly why Shirov didn't play 16.Rb1. Did he understand that it was an objectively bad move, see some deep tactical refutation, or just prefer to return material over passive defense. It seems clear that black gets prolonged play for the piece, but I don't see how he can convert it to something before the material tells. Another issue is that white's position could be very fun to play after 16.Qe4.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake by discussing the potential advantages of 16.Rb1 for White and highlighting the prolonged play for Black, while also suggesting that White could have fun in the position after 16.Qe4.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13. Ke2 Nc5 14. b4 Rd8 15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Qe4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Eingorn, Viacheslav (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e4"
"This move really ""made the game"" for me. There's something about the wide open space around white's centralized monarch that makes it seem odd that white is the one attacking the opponent's king. Thus, the sheer audacity of the move is immediately compelling. Unfortunately the logical reasons for the move are not so easy to explain without getting into detailed variations, but I find this is often the case with Shirov's games; rarely could he be accused of playing transparently!",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it primarily focuses on the player's audacity and strategy rather than a specific flaw in the move itself.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13. Ke2 Nc5 14. b4 Rd8 15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Qe4 Qb3 17. Bd2 Rxd2+ 18. Kxd2 Qb2+ 19.

It turns out that this is probably the losing mistake.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, implying that the move likely led to a negative outcome in the game.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13. Ke2 Nc5 14. b4 Rd8 15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Qe4 Qb3 17. Bd2 Rxd2+ 18. Kxd2 Qb2+ 19.

Desperation.,True,"

The comment ""Desperation"" likely indicates that the player made a suboptimal move due to being under pressure or in a difficult situation, suggesting a mistake made in their strategy.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13. Ke2 Nc5 14. b4 Rd8 15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Qe4 Qb3 17. Bd2 Rxd2+ 18. Kxd2 Qb2+ 19.

"The most precise, as black's king is badly placed on d7.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, as placing the black king on d7 can indeed be a vulnerability in certain situations.",1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 d5 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. Qxd5 O-O 11. f4 Qb6 12. Nf3 Bf2+ 13. Ke2 Nc5 14. b4 Rd8 15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Qe4 Qb3 17. Bd2 Rxd2+ 18. Kxd2 Qb2+ 19.
