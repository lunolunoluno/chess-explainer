"Here, black was at a crossroads. He prefers, in this game, the most popular continuation - a forced transition into the endgame. A sharp middlegame, but with a certain risk for black, awaits him after 9...Nb6 10.d5. It is easier for black to defend after 10.Be3 e6 11.0-0-0 Be7 12.d5 exd5 13.Bxb6 Qxb6 14.Qxb6 axb6 15.Nxd5 Rxa2 16.Kb1 Ra5! with an equal endgame. In Anand-Karolyi (Frunze 1987), white chose to keep the bishop: 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.Rxd5 Qc7 15.Kb1 0-0 16.f4 Nb4! 17.Rd4 Nc6 18.Rd1 Bf6 19.Bg2, but it seems that black's position is quite defensible. After 10.d5 Nd4 11.Qd1 e5 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Be3 Bc5, we arrive at the extremely sharp position shown in the analysis The practice of the last several years shows that black can maintain equality. Here are several examples: 1) 14.Bg2 Qh4 15.0-0 Bd6 16.h3 Nf5 17.Qb3 0-0 18.Qxe6+ Kh8 19.Qe4 Qf6 20.Qg4 Qf7 and black has sufficient compensation for the pawn (Malaniuk-Yudasin, USSR Championship, Moscow 1991), or 2) 14.b4 0-0 15.bxc5 Nxf3+ 16.Ke2 Qf6 17.cxb6 (17.Bg2?! Nc4! is in black's favor) 17...Rad8 18.Qc2 Nd4+ 19.Bxd4 Qxd4 20.Ne4 Qxa1 21.Bg2 Qe5 with mutual chances (Hansen,L-Kuijf, Graested 1990).",True,"

"The natural-looking intermediate exchange 13...Nxc3 14.bxc3 with the goal of compromising white's pawn structure turns out to favor white. The b-file opens up, and the white rook puts it to good use. Black, meanwhile, experiences difficulty in completing his kingside development. The game Fischer-Euwe (Leipzig Olympiad 1960) serves as an excellent illustration of white's play in an ending of this type: 14...Qd7 15.Rb1! Rd8?! (more tenacious is 15...Qxb5 16.Rxb5 Kd6, although after 17.Rb7 the rook is boss on the seventh rank) 16.Be3 Qxb5 17.Rxb5 Rd7 18.Ke2 f6 19.Rd1! Rxd1 20.Kxd1 Kd7 21.Rb8 Kc6 22.Bxa7 g5 23.a4, and the extra passed pawn decided the fate of the game. 14...f6 looks stronger, preparing the evacuation of the king: 15.Qb7+ Ke8 16.Rb1 Qc8! is not dangerous, as black plays Kf7 next. If white plays the obvious 15.Ba3+ Kf7 16.Rd1 Qc8 17.Rd7+ Kg8, the king hides from the threats after h7-h5.",True," The comment provides a detailed analysis of a specific move and its consequences, suggesting a mistake was made due to insufficient evaluation of the resulting pawn structure and potential tactical threats.",1. e4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4.

"Sometimes white decides to induce the weakening of black's position with the intermediate 15.Bg5+ f6 16.Qxd5 exd5 17.Be3, and yet this does not give white any advantage.

For instance, 18.0-0-0 Bb4 19.a3 Rhc8+ 20.Kb1 Bc5 21.Rhe1 Bxe3 22.Rxe3+ Kd6 23.Rde1 Rc4, and the weakness of the h2 pawn is felt (Belikov-Dreev, Moscow 1992).

"After a brief opening shootout, the game has been transformed into an endgame with the isolani on d5. The true evaluation of this position determines how secure the entire plan with 5...Nc6 is, because modern theory considers this position the optimal achievement for white in this variation. The presence of the doubled pawns on the f-file is compensated by the possibility to attack the weak pawns d5 and a7 in black's position. Obviously, the key freeing maneuver for black is Ke7-e6 with the development of the bishop. But this takes time. The evaluation of this endgame depends upon how white can utilize this time.

For instance, 18.Be3 Be7 19.Rac1 Bf6 20.Rc5 Rhd8 21.b4 Ke6 22.b5 d4 and black's central counterplay compensates for white's flank activity.

"With this move, white looks to attack the a7 pawn and simultaneously threatens to discoordinate the black forces by Rd4-f4.
