"Every chess player must progress through stages. At the age of 15 and a rating of 1179 this is not a good opening for you. Until you reach the 1500+ level you should play some variety of 1. e4 (in your case you may want to explore the King's Indian Attack).

Generally in Queen's Pawn games the idea is to play c4 before Nc3. The idea is to take up space in the center with the c-pawn.

When you are ahead this much material follow a basic principle: trade into oblivion! The idea is to take out the opponent's most dangerous piece. In this case the target is the Queen.

"22. Be6+ Kh8 23. Rf2. Remember that ""check"" is a free move. It's like getting to move twice in a row. Always consider the forced moves first.
