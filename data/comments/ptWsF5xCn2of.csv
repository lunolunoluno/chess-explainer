"C57: Two Knights: Wilkes-Barre/Traxler and 4 Ng5 d5 5 exd5, unusual Black 5th moves",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake as it highlights the unusual nature of the Black's 5th move, which deviates from the standard responses in the Traxler Counterattack.",1. e4,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
"If black play s the immediate 5... Nxd5?, then white can crush black's position with 6. Nxf7! Typical play might look like this: 6... Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 8. Nc3 Ncb4 9. Qe4 c6 10. a3 Na6 11. f4! Nac7 12. fxe5 Ke7 13. d4 Ke8 14. O-O.",True,"

The comment provides a clear sequence of moves showing how white can exploit black's mistake with a powerful attack, which effectively explains the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5"
The Ulvestad Variation.,False,"

The comment ""The Ulvestad Variation"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it refers to a specific line of play rather than the nature of the mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
"The odd looking retreat of this Bishop is designed to prevent Qxg2 after 6... Qxd5 7. Nc3. Other alternatives give black a good game. For example, 6. Bb3 Nd4 7. d6?! Nxb3 8. dxc7 Qxc7 9. axb3 abandons the center to black's very active play for only a pawn. Also, 6. Bxb5 Qxd5 7. Nc3 Qxg2 8. Qf3 Qxf3 9. Nxf3 Bd7 is OK for black.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by highlighting the poor alternative retreat of the Bishop and providing stronger move options for Black.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f1"
"A new move ! The book line is 6... Qxd5 Nc3 7. Qd6 (7. Qc5?! leaves the Queen too exposed). Black can also play 6... h6 which drops a pawn for active play. 6... h6 7. Nxf7 Kxf7 8. dxc6 Bc5 (Kirilov - Shebenyuk, coor. 1985.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting alternative, stronger moves and pointing out the downsides of the chosen move, specifically mentioning the potential for active play and the weaknesses in the opponent's position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d4"
Black's pieces swarm around white. Now if 9. d3 then 9... Bg4 10. Qd2 entombs many of white's pieces.,True,"

The comment accurately evaluates the mistake made by White, indicating that their move allows Black to gain a significant advantage by attacking the queen and immobilizing White's pieces.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h4"
How should black respond with two pieces hanging? Attack of course!,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests that black should have taken advantage of the situation by attacking.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"
Black sacrifices material until it hurts. Play is now razor sharp on the king side.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as Black willingly gave up material for a strategic initiative, leading to a sharp attack on the king side.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6"
White is a piece up with no peace. How should white respond to black's threat of 14... fxg2 attacking both white's Rook and Queen? The natural 14. gxf3 is refuted by 14... Bxg3 15. hxg3 Qxg3+ 16. Kh1 Nf4 17. Qe2 (forced) Nxe2 winning.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the inadequate defensive move of 14. gxf3 and the subsequent threats that follow, leading to a significant material loss for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6 12. Bxb5+ Kd8 13. O-O exf3,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f3"
"This may be the losing move. After 14. Qe1!, black will find it hard to justify his material sacrifice.",True,"

The comment accurately points out a potential mistake by highlighting the material sacrifice and challenges Black may face in justifying it.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6 12. Bxb5+ Kd8 13. O-O exf3 14. Rxf3,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on f3"
Black's attack has regained the lost material. Now it is only a matter of endgame technique.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by Black as the loss of material can be turned into a regained situation through proper endgame technique.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6 12. Bxb5+ Kd8 13. O-O exf3 14. Rxf3 Rb8 15. Be2 Bxf3 16. Bxf3 Qxd4+ 17. Kh1 Bxg3 18. hxg3 Rb6 19. d3 Ne3 20. Bxe3 Qxe3 21. Bg4 h5 22. Bh3 g5 23. Nd2 g4 24. Nc4 Qxg3 25. Nxb6 gxh3 26. Qf3 hxg2+ 27. Qxg2 Qxg2+ 28. Kxg2 cxb6,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on b6"
"Why you might ask did white stop short of capturing on a7? Indeed, 40. Rxa7 is better. No doubt that after white saw that the capture on a7 loses also, he decided to complicate matters in the hope that black might go wrong.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that white made a mistake by not capturing on a7, which would have been a better move, and instead, chose to complicate the position, hoping black would make an error.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6 12. Bxb5+ Kd8 13. O-O exf3 14. Rxf3 Rb8 15. Be2 Bxf3 16. Bxf3 Qxd4+ 17. Kh1 Bxg3 18. hxg3 Rb6 19. d3 Ne3 20. Bxe3 Qxe3 21. Bg4 h5 22. Bh3 g5 23. Nd2 g4 24. Nc4 Qxg3 25. Nxb6 gxh3 26. Qf3 hxg2+ 27. Qxg2 Qxg2+ 28. Kxg2 cxb6 29. Rf1 Ke7 30. Re1+ Kd6 31. Rf1 Rc8 32.

Rb7,"This is a game between Estrin, Yakov (Soviet Union) (as White) and Berliner, Hans (United States) (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to b7"
With this move white resigned. There is little use in wasting postage on a lost game. The game might have continued: 43. Rb7 b2 44. a7 Ra4 when black's b-pawn cannot be stopped.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it only states that white resigned and suggests a potential continuation, without pointing out the specific error made.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bf1 Nd4 7. c3 Nxd5 8. Ne4 Qh4 9. Ng3 Bg4 10. f3 e4 11. cxd4 Bd6 12. Bxb5+ Kd8 13. O-O exf3 14. Rxf3 Rb8 15. Be2 Bxf3 16. Bxf3 Qxd4+ 17.
