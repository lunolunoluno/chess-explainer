"An important feature. Russians say not without reason, that ""long"" castling is long not only for that reason that the rook makes a long transit, but also because it must be ""completed"" with the move Kb1. Besides of this useful prophylactic, White plans (expecting queenside black castling) to transfer his Knight via a route Ne2-c1-b3 to the a5-square. From here it will exert pressure on the Black's queenside, weakened by pawn moves. However, this plan looks somewhat slow, and Black has time for counter-chances.",True," The comment provides a justification for the mistake, outlining a strategic plan that seems unnecessarily complex and potentially leads to a disadvantage for White.",1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3.
