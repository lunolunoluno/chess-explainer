"As compensation for his sacrificed pawn White has a considerable lead in development, and this can lead to a direct attack if he can open up the position. This can be achieved only one way - by the central thrust Pd5",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic goal but doesn't directly address the flawed move itself.",1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4.

"Typical Nimzowitsch! He is going to maneuver his Knight to d5, in order to assert control over the vital d5 square, thus making d5 problematic. This is the strategy which Nimzowitsch called centralization. A player of the old stame - such as Dr. Tarrasch - would have reacted to this move with undisguised horror. It is flagrant violation of the well known rule: Do not play any piece twice in the opening",True," The comment accurately identifies a problematic move and connects it to a recognized chess strategy, suggesting a missed opportunity.",1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4.

"Black explains his last two moves by the need to ""overprotect"" the central d5. This is another of the ideas he introduced into practise. Strategically important points must be overprotected. The pieces which will thereby be well-placed, and as soon as the strategic point concerned finds itself in the front line, the overprotecting pieces will automatically attain maximum activity. Anyone who takes the trouble to glance back at the Steinitz chapter may come to the conclusion that Steinitiz and Nimzowitsch perhaps stand closer together than a superficial examination might suggest",True," The comment provides a rationale for the mistake, suggesting a flawed strategic concept rooted in overprotection, indicating a potential misjudgment.",1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4.

Castling is deferred.

With the intention of a counterattack in the centre - dangerous tactics while the opponent is better developed. Nimzowitsch correctly concluded that 16. ...
