"#This came a complete shock. The move is given as dubious in all the books which quote a previus game from my opponent! That game (Maksimenko - Gyimesi 1997) continued 16.Qb3 b5 17.Qg3 Bd7 18.Qg7 Ke7 19.f4 Nc6 and White has a clear advantage. Obviously my opponent must have an improvement, and the more I analysed this game the less I trusted the line given in the books. I really didn't know what to do in this position and eventually decided to centralise and hope!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it suggests they were unaware of a better move (as mentioned in the book) and chose to centralize and hope instead, which indicates a less informed decision.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

(as White) and Gyimesi, Z. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e5"," '#This move was unexpected. Previous analyses of Gyimesi's game against Maksimenko in 1997 suggest a strong position for White. However, this game (Maksimenko - Gyimesi 1997) showcased a turning point with 16.Qb3 b5 17.Qg3 Bd7 18.Qg7 Ke7 19.f4 Nc6. White was in a clear advantage. My analysis led to the conclusion that there must have been an improvement in Gyimesi's play to deviate from the established pattern. Unsure of the best course of action, I opted for a more cautious approach, centralizing my pieces.'"
"A important decision. I had expected 18...Ke7 (with the idea of RHd8) 19.f4 Ng6 20.g3 which I thought was level, but my opponent thought was better for White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, indicating that they resigned due to a significant material disadvantage that would result in losing a piece.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
