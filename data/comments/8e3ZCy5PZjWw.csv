"This move entails a loss of time and White should be able to gain the advantage, but it is not as easy as one might expect. There are two reasonable plans. White can either continue with Bxc6 and d3 with an extra tempo, or he can open the position with Bxc6 and Nxe5, hoping to exploit Black's centralised king. Both plans are promising.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by suggesting two alternative plans and highlighting the missed opportunities to gain an advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 a6,"This is a game between Znosko Borovsky, E. (as White) and Rubinstein, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"," Black's last move, advancing a pawn to a6, could be seen as a strategic error. As White, they now have an opportunity to regain time. They have two effective plans to follow. The first option is to play Bxc6, which would allow an extra turn, followed by d3, a strong move. Alternatively, White could opt for Bxc6, aiming to take advantage of Black's central king's position by playing Nxe5. Both options offer a chance to improve White's position."
"This is normally given a question mark, but the real error only comes nextmove.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 a6 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 Qd4 8. O-O Qxe5 9. Re1 Be6 10. d4 Qf5 11.

"This is probably less effective than the simple 12.Qd2, when White has the same type of slight advantage. 12...",True,"
The comment accurately identifies a less effective move and suggests a better alternative, indicating that the player made a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 a6 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 Qd4 8. O-O Qxe5 9. Re1 Be6 10. d4 Qf5 11. Bg5 Bd6 12. g4,"This is a game between Znosko Borovsky, E. (as White) and Rubinstein, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g4", White's move with the pawn to g4 is less effective than the straightforward 12.Qd2. It's because White still has a slight advantage with 12.Qd2.
"A serious error. After 12...Qd5 or 12...Qb5 White has no forcing continuation, and the weakening of his kingside resulting from the move g4 improves Black's long-term chances for counterplay.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the lack of forcing continuation for White and the potential for Black to improve their position due to the weakening of White's kingside.",1. e4 e5 2.

(as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to g6"," They made a significant mistake. White has no strong moves after Black's 12th move. Moving the g-pawn weakens White's king's side, which gives Black better chances for counter-attacks."
The rest is a nightmare for Black:,True,"
