Kasparov had a fondness for this system of Petrosian's in the 1980s.,False,"

The comment refers to a historical chess system and doesn't explain the specific mistake made by the player in the given move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
This method of seeking early exchanges is distinctly dubious.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it directly addresses the strategy of seeking early exchanges, which is the player's objective that led to the loss.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4"
"From a strategical standpoint, this move refutes Black's opening. Now Black can retreat with 7...Bb7 but after 8.e4, White has a distinct positional advantage.",True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake by highlighting the strategic disadvantage created by the move, which allows Black to easily retreat with a less aggressive position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d2"
"Now that the Black bishop has departed from the h1-a8 diagonal, Kasparov takes it for himself.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it only states that Kasparov takes the bishop when it has moved.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g3"
"It would seem more appropriate to play 8...c6 9.Bg2 d5, but after 10.0-0, White has the freer and easier game to play.",True,"

The comment correctly explains that the player missed the opportunity to prepare for Black's pawn break with...c6 and the bishop's positioning with Bg2, which would have helped White to maintain control and a more comfortable position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"Andersson seeks counterplay with b6-b5, but his lag in development is a cause for concern.",True,"

The annotation correctly points out the player's mistake in lagging behind in development while attempting to create counterplay.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"
"After 10...d5 11.Bb2 Be7 12.Rc1 Qd7 13.Bg2 0-0 14.cxd5 exd5 15.Qb3, White has a clear advantage.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as White gains a clear advantage after Black's 15...exd5, which allows White to dominate the center and develop their pieces effectively.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
"Ulf Andersson has a reputation for being a very patient and solid defender, and thus a very difficult man to beat. This retreat of the knight has a view to the maneuver Na7-c8, followed by d7-d5 and Nc8-d6-c4. But White has some moves first!",True,"

The comment correctly identifies a mistake by Ulf Andersson, explaining the potential maneuver and acknowledging White's possible moves, which contribute to understanding the strategic context.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to a7"
"Exploiting the misplaced ""Queen's Indian bishop. """,True,"

The comment accurately identifies a potential mistake by referring to a common trap involving the move of the Queen's Indian bishop.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7.

Better was 13...h5.,True,"

The comment accurately points out that the previous move was a mistake and suggests a better alternative, h5.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h6"
A strong positional pawn sacrifice that opens the long diagonal for White's dark-squared bishop.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out a potential strategic advantage gained from the pawn sacrifice, which could have been a deliberate sacrifice rather than an error.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"
"White's compensation for his pawn is enormous - a massive lead in development, two raking bishops, and a weakness on g7 that prevents Black catching up in development in a normal manner.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by the player, explaining the consequences of the pawn sacrifice in terms of development advantage and positional weakness.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"
"The target is the Black king, with the e3-e4 break scheduled.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates an oversight of the position where the King is a target and the upcoming e3-e4 pawn move is critical for a potential attack.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O f6 17. Re1,"This is a game between Kasparov, G (as White) and Andersson, U (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1"

Now there are all manner of tactics brewing against the f6 and g7 points in the Black position.,True,"

"Hoping to muster a ""second rank defense ""with Ra8-a7. Losing alternatives included 22...Rf8 23.Rad1 d5 24.Nxf6! when mate is unavoidable, and 22...Re8 23.Qg6+ Kf8, when in his notes, Kasparov gives 24.g4! with the idea of Ne4-g3-f5 as winning. While this is adequate, I analyzed the following forcing continuation: 24.Ng5! hxg5 25.h6 gxh6 26.Qxh6+ Kf7 (or 26...Kg8 27.Qg6+ Kf8 (27...Kh8 28.Kg2!) 28.Kg2! - a ""quiet ""move when Black cannot unravel in time to meet the threat of Re1-h1-h8+.) 27.Qh7+ Kf8 28.Kg2! and now: a) 28...Bd6 29.Qh8+ Kf7 30.Rxe8 Qae8 31.Qxf6+ Kg8 32.Qg7 mate; b) 28...Nc8 29.Qg6 Nd6 29.Rh1 Nf7 30.Rh7, winning; c) 28...d5 29.Bd4! c5 30.Qg6! cxd4 31.Rh1 Bd6 32.Rh7!

Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O f6 17. Re1 Be7 18.

White also wins after 24...Bxf6 25.Qg6+ Kf8 26.Bxf6 gxf6 27.Re6.,True,"

The annotator explains the strategic mistake by showing the sequence of moves that leads to White's significant advantage after Black's blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O f6 17. Re1 Be7 18. Qg4 Kf7 19. h5 Bh7 20. e4 dxe4 21. Bxe4 Bxe4 22. Nxe4 Nc8 23.

A final knock-out punch. The bishop cannot be captured because of immediate mate.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake, as it implies that there was an immediate threat of mate that prevented the bishop from being captured, which is not a logical reason for a move to be considered a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Ne4 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. Nd2 Bg6 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 a6 10. b4 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bb2 Na7 13. h4 h6 14. d5 exd5 15. Bg2 c6 16. O-O f6 17. Re1 Be7 18.

"Black Resigned After the forced 30...Rg8, then simply 31.h6 decides the issue. A powerful tour de force by Kasparov.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, highlighting a forced move that would have led to a loss (30...Rg8), and acknowledges a winning strategy by a famous grandmaster (Kasparov).",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
