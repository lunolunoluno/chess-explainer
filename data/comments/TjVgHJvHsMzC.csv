1. e4 e6 2. Nf3,"I played this quickly but I had been thinking about whether or not to do it ever since I found out who my opponent was, i.e. about five minutes before the game. The point is that against the Winawer I play a slightly offbeat line, and pretty successfully, but I was afraid that it wouldn't hold up against a GM. This line is less ambitious, but it makes him think about how to make the game interesting.",False

However I was also fairly confident that I would give him a hell of a time trying to beat me in the endgame, where I felt more confident of my abilities than in French-style complications that he is probably very familiar with. So this is a decision based mainly on off-the-board considerations.",True

I saw the more obvious 13.O-O-O first, but I didn't feel there was enough for the pawn yet. Then it hit me that it might be best to keep the pawn for one more move and let black decide what to do in the mean time. Nonetheless, the move is a mistake because in actual fact I do not get enough for the pawn even after 14.O-O-O.",True

I'm still not sure exactly what black's idea is, but I have a couple of guesses. One is that he wants to play ...Bd6 with tempo since I will not be able to reply Qh5.  There is also an idea that, strangely, he did not try to implement in the game.  In rough form it is to play ...Bxf2, Bc5, Bxf8, Bg7, etc. In any case, it seems to me that this is one of the more relavent things he can do with his time, compared to 13...a6, for example.",False
