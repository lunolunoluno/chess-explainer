"I played this quickly but I had been thinking about whether or not to do it ever since I found out who my opponent was, i.e. about five minutes before the game. The point is that against the Winawer I play a slightly offbeat line, and pretty successfully, but I was afraid that it wouldn't hold up against a GM. This line is less ambitious, but it makes him think about how to make the game interesting.",True," The comment provides context for why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting over-analysis and a potentially risky approach.",1. e4 e6 2.

"This cost me a lot of time. I saw the more obvious 13.O-O-O first, but I didn't feel there was enough for the pawn yet. Then it hit me that it might be best to keep the pawn for one more move and let black decide what to do in the mean time.

"Definitely a creative response. I'm still not sure exactly what black's idea is, but I have a couple of guesses. One is that he wants to play ...Bd6 with tempo since I will not be able to reply Qh5. There is also an idea that, strangely, he did not try to implement in the game.

"Reaching an interesting endgame. White can try to take advantage of his active rook to recover material, but I chose another plan.
