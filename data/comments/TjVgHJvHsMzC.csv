"I played this quickly but I had been thinking about whether or not to do it ever since I found out who my opponent was, i.e. about five minutes before the game. The point is that against the Winawer I play a slightly offbeat line, and pretty successfully, but I was afraid that it wouldn't hold up against a GM. This line is less ambitious, but it makes him think about how to make the game interesting.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it acknowledges the player's hesitation and fear of the opponent's skill level, which indicates a lack of confidence and could lead to a suboptimal move choice.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3,"This is a game between Hartwig, Tom (as White) and Kaminski, Marcin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"," 'White made the move with the Knight to f3 hastily. They had been contemplating this decision for about five minutes before the game started, considering whether the offbeat line from Winawer could stand against a Grandmaster. This line, although less ambitious, was aimed at making Black think about how to keep the game engaging.'"
"This is what I wanted, and now I can go back into d4 lines.",True,"

The comment likely refers to a pawn move that the player wanted, but it resulted in a mistake because it weakened their position or opened up a tactical vulnerability.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6,"This is a game between Hartwig, Tom (as White) and Kaminski, Marcin (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6", The move to f6 was not strategic. White should consider advancing to d4 lines for a stronger position.
"I was aware that black can probably equalize immediately now with 9... fe 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Bxe5 Nxe5 12.Qxe5 Qf6. However I was also fairly confident that I would give him a hell of a time trying to beat me in the endgame, where I felt more confident of my abilities than in French-style complications that he is probably very familiar with. So this is a decision based mainly on off-the-board considerations.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights their off-the-board considerations, where they prioritized their perceived strength in the endgame over immediate equality in the position.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2,"This is a game between Hartwig, Tom (as White) and Kaminski, Marcin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"," It's unfortunate that White played 9...fe, as this move allows Black to equalize quickly. The sequence 9...fe 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Bxe5 Nxe5 12.Qxe5 Qf6 shows a straightforward response that breaks the center and does not challenge White's position. While I feel confident in my endgame, this early move by Black leaves White in a comfortable position without the need for complex complications. This decision stems from a desire to maintain a solid position rather than engage in an immediate endgame battle."
He doesn't want to play the endgame either. Good.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it refers to the player's strategy regarding the endgame, not a specific error in a previous move.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2 fxe5 10. Nxe5 Ndxe5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxe5 O-O,"This is a game between Hartwig, Tom (as White) and Kaminski, Marcin (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle",-
"This cost me a lot of time. I saw the more obvious 13.O-O-O first, but I didn't feel there was enough for the pawn yet. Then it hit me that it might be best to keep the pawn for one more move and let black decide what to do in the mean time. Nonetheless, the move is a mistake because in actual fact I do not get enough for the pawn even after 14.O-O-O.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of the player's thought process and the rationale behind considering the move a mistake, highlighting the lack of sufficient compensation for the pawn.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2 fxe5 10. Nxe5 Ndxe5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxe5 O-O 13. Rf1,"This is a game between Hartwig, Tom (as White) and Kaminski, Marcin (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to f1"," White's last move was a rook to f1, which took considerable time to decide. The initial instinct was to castle long (13.O-O-O), though the pawn wasn't ready for the move. By opting to delay the castle, it was thought that Black's response would dictate the next step. However, the decision is flawed as White doesn't acquire enough in return after 14.O-O-O."
"Definitely a creative response. I'm still not sure exactly what black's idea is, but I have a couple of guesses. One is that he wants to play ...Bd6 with tempo since I will not be able to reply Qh5. There is also an idea that, strangely, he did not try to implement in the game. In rough form it is to play ...Bxf2, Bc5, Bxf8, Bg7, etc. In any case, it seems to me that this is one of the more relavent things he can do with his time, compared to 13...a6, for example.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting alternative strategies that could have been more relevant to the situation.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2 fxe5 10. Nxe5 Ndxe5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxe5 O-O 13.

Possibly, Black could play...Bd6, aiming to gain tempo with Qh5 not being a viable reply. Alternatively, they could consider the sequence...Bxf2, Bc5, Bxf8, Bg7, etc., which might be more relevant with Black's time. However, it's essential to note that 13...a6 also holds potential."
This was my original idea and an interesting one. Unfortunately here I missed a straghtforward chance to beat a GM...,True,"

The comment explains that the player missed a straightforward opportunity to defeat a Grandmaster, which indicates a mistake in their decision-making process during the game.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3.

It was a simple, yet effective play that could have secured an advantage."""
"He played this quickly, presumably happy because in the ending he is not likely to lose, i.e. the old ""playing for two results""... yet Fritz found another spoiler.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to focus more on the player's possible mindset (hoping for a draw in the endgame) and the existence of a blunder, rather than the specific reasons for the move being incorrect.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2 fxe5 10. Nxe5 Ndxe5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxe5 O-O 13. Rf1 g6 14. O-O-O Bxf2 15. Kb1 Bd7 16.

"Reaching an interesting endgame. White can try to take advantage of his active rook to recover material, but I chose another plan. Basically it consists of playing like a pansy and holding the fort at e2. Since black's extra pawn is crippled, I think this offers excellent chances of getting a draw.",True,"

The comment acknowledges that the move was a mistake, providing an alternative strategy that could improve the game's outcome.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7.

Better to take material advantage, aiming for a potential win rather than settling for a draw.'"
Sticking to the plan. I wasn't even interested in surrendering the d-file for a pawn.,True,"

The comment indicates that the player made a mistake by allowing the opponent to gain control of the d-file, which they did not intend to do, acknowledging the error in their strategy.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Bf4 f6 9. Qe2 fxe5 10. Nxe5 Ndxe5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxe5 O-O 13. Rf1 g6 14. O-O-O Bxf2 15. Kb1 Bd7 16. Ne4 dxe4 17. Bc4 Qf6 18.

"Black's winning idea is to encourage me to move my pawns. For example after g3 he can think about ...h7-h5-h4, while h3 might allow something like ...Kg3 ...Rxf3 (presumably I will put my bishop on f3).

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting potential threats and the strategic implications of the move.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7.

"Plan A is to put the king on e2 and avoid moving my queenside pawns, which will become feasible if I can get in a3 and Rd4.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it discusses a future plan rather than addressing the previously played move.",1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3.

"Plan B. The queenside pawns move after all, and my king returns to its post on c2. The rook ends up miserably defending b5 so my kingside is safe.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it details the positioning of pieces after the move was made, suggesting the player's intent was to reposition the queenside pawns and the king, while also commenting on the rook's position.",1. e4 e6 2.

"He offered a draw here. Only white can play to win, but if I do so with, for example, Ra1, then ...Rd7 gives black chances too.",True,"
