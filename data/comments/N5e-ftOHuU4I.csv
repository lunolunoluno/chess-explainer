The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that Vienna's retake of the bishop with the knight did not provide better defense options and was not as thoroughly analyzed as the alternative move.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Queen takes on d2"," Here is the simplified explanation of the move played:

""In the match, Vienna (Black) made a move that does not seem to provide better defense. This choice might give them an advantage for match play, as it hasn't been analyzed as much as the strategy used by London (White) in the previous game."""
"In the altered position this appears better than the mode of development for this knight advocated by Messrs Potter and Steinitz in their analysis of the above quoted game, namely 9...Nh6 (see The Field, April 18, 1874). The chief reason given by those two examiners was the weakness of Black's f-pawn, which might more specially compromise the defense, since the first player had, in a great many variations, fine opportunities of attacking that weak point with one of his knights; but in the present position, after the queen in place of the knight has retaken the bishop, such a contingency was too remote to be taken into serious consideration, and it was probably the best course to defend at once the point at d5 against any future occupation from either of the adversary's knights.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by discussing the potential weakness of Black's f-pawn and the better course of action to defend the d5 square against future knight attacks.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"," 'The decision to move Knight to f6 isn't ideal. It's not the development plan by Potter and Steinitz, who suggest Nh6. The primary concern is the vulnerability of Black's f-pawn, which White could potentially exploit with one of their knights. However, with White's queen now on d1, any attack on d5 is unlikely. Therefore, fortifying d5 seems the more prudent move.'"
"12...b5, blocking out the opponent's a-knight, was tempting, but would have been thoroughly unsound, e.g., 12...b5 13.Bf3 Qc5 (best) 14.b4 Qb6 (best) 15.Qg5 Rg8 16.Nd5 and wins.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic disadvantage of the move 12...b5, as it weakens the pawn structure and allows for tactical threats leading to a win for the opponent.",1. e4 e5 2.

After 13.Bf3, Black's best response is Qc5, which safely retreats the queen and maintains pressure. Continuing with 14.b4, Black keeps the pressure but must play Qb6 to avoid tactical issues. The sequence 15.Qg5 Rg8 16.Nd5 leads to a winning position for White, as Black's attempt to blockade the knight has led to a substantial material imbalance."

"An important move, not alone to prevent the hostile queen from establishing herself at any of the strong posts on the kingside, but also to enable Black to bring his own queen into greater security by constantly offering the exchange of queens.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the missed opportunity to prevent their opponent's queen from establishing a strong position on the kingside and also the missed chance to improve Black's own queen's security.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Black's last two moves were made under the pressure of time limit, and under the impression that he could advance the pawn to b5 if the opponent retreated the queen to b3; but it appears that after White's next answer this expedient could not be adopted, e.g., 19.Qb3 b5 20.Bf3 Bb7 21.Qxf7 Ne5 22.Rxe5 Qxe5 23.Bxb7 Rb8 24.Bc6, etc.",True,"
