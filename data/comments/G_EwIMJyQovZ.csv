"A very typical and well regarded idea in the Najdorf. The position is not the same, but the basic outline in both cases is - we are dealing with a fight for the e5-square. What is interesting in this case is that white is successful and in a convincing way. Admittedly there is a concrete mistake around move 20 by black before he can be overcome, but you have to realize that HE LOST PLAYING COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE MOVES. I.e., the only mistake he made was only a mistake because of the sophisticated way white punished it in this game.

"A very classical, straightforward approach to the position. White is going to play h4 which opens the h-file (benefitting him because he has a lead in development and can swing his rooks across the first rank) and, more importantly fights for e5 by knocking out the props from under it.

"I think this may be black's only mistake in the whole game. Apparently, it gets out of the way of the coming f4-fork and would have to be played anyway. Furthermore, I think it might have been hard for black to imagine how he could possibly be worse in the resulting position.
