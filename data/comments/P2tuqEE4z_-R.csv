A strange loo king move which I was not able to find in any of the games in my database. It is not clear at all what black intends to do with his h8 rook. Perhaps an atack on the king side? He should better have thought ofdevelopment first. In any event black already has difficulties as is to be seen from the follwing variants:,True,"

The comment accurately points out the potential oversight in the player's move by suggesting that the player may have missed an opportunity for better development and possibly a king-side attack, indicating that the move could be considered a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8,"This is a game between Enev, Zlatko (as White) and Goudreau, Alec (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8"
? Of course this sounds stupid but I cannot say exactly why I have played this move. I was not able to find any serious refutation of the simple 9.Nc3. I must have been trying to keep the bisho pair at any rate - but the price is too high and it is only the weak play of the oponent that allowed me to come out as a winner. I think the black position is rather acceptable after he gets rid of the d5 pawn.,True,"

The comment explains the player's error by admitting the move was a mistake, acknowledging their inability to find a refutation, and justifying the move based on the opponent's weak play.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

"!? of course this looks very good but it might have been even better to prepare the move by first playing 12...Ng4, e. g.:",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake in the played move by suggesting a better alternative move, 12...Ng4, which demonstrates an understanding of the game's dynamics and strategic depth.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

I did not like 13.d5 because of the following line:,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it indicates that the move ""13.d5"" was not well-received, suggesting it might have led to a disadvantageous line.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

? Black loses the thread here. He could still have fought for advantage in the following line:,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a mistake made by the black player, suggesting that they lost control of the situation and could have potentially defended better in the subsequent moves.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

!,False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made by the player, as it lacks a specific move reference or explanation.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8 7.

"? Black continues with purely defensive, passive play which in this position equals slow death. He should have in any event tried something more activelike:",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it points out that the player's passive move does not exploit the opportunity for active play, which could potentially lead to a better position or advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8 7. O-O Nbd7 8. d4 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nbxd5 10. c4 Ne3 11. Bxe3 fxe3 12. Qxe3 c5 13. Nc3 Ng4 14. Qd2 Bf5 15. g3 Nf6 16. Ng5 g6 17.

"?? This move is so incomprehesible to me that I consider it the weakest in the whole game. Why does he not play the natural Kg7 here? That could have allowed him to keep the position since the rook finally comes into play, e. g.:",True,"

The comment justifies the move's poor quality by highlighting the missed opportunity to improve the position with a more strategic play.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6.

? Holding on to that passive style. He might have been afraid of the lines following 21.. .Bd6 22.Nb5 but that row of pieces on the eight rank does not look good at all,False,"

The comment does not directly address the mistake made by the player but rather comments on their general playing style and the potential consequences of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8 7. O-O Nbd7 8. d4 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nbxd5 10. c4 Ne3 11. Bxe3 fxe3 12. Qxe3 c5 13. Nc3 Ng4 14. Qd2 Bf5 15. g3 Nf6 16. Ng5 g6 17. Rae1 Be7 18. d5 h6 19. Nf3 Bh3 20.

"? This loses per force. Black had here the good move 24...Bh6, e. g.:",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as ""? This loses per force,"" indicating that the move was a significant error that would lead to a loss in the best-case scenario.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8 7.

Here black resigned. I think this was a prematured decision given the following lines:,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the resignation was premature and suggests that there were still viable alternatives for the player to continue the game.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.
