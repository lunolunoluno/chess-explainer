1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 6. Qe2+ Kf8,"A strange loo king move which I was not able to find in any of the games in my
database. It is not clear at all what black intends to do with his h8 rook.
Perhaps an atack on the king side? He should better have thought ofdevelopment
first. In any event black already has difficulties as is to be seen from the
follwing variants:",True

say exactly why I have played this move. I was not able to find any serious
refutation of the simple 9.Nc3. I must have been trying to keep the bisho pair
at any rate - but the price is too high and it is only the weak play of the
oponent that allowed me to come out as a winner. I think the black position is
rather acceptable after he gets rid of the d5 pawn.",False

it might have been even better to prepare the move by first playing 12...Ng4,

He could still have fought for advantage in the following line:",True

equals slow death. He should have in any event tried something more activelike:",True

is so incomprehesible to me that I consider it the weakest in the whole game.
Why does he not play the natural Kg7 here? That could have allowed him to keep
the position since the rook finally comes into play, e. g.:",True

on to that passive style. He might have been afraid of the lines following 21..
