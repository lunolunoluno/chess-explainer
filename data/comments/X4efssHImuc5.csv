"Moscow Variation -- After this White will either establish a white square pawn formation (Pc4, Pe4) to replace the effect of the bishop (to the extent they can) or aim for c2-c3, d2-d4 and possibly d4-d5 or e4-e5. The move also works to enable O-O quickly. 3. Bc4 is interesting and has been played recently, but 3. d4 is still the most common move.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it provides alternative strategies White could employ after Black's move, which indicates that the initial move was not the best choice.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5 with check"
"This is unusual, but not necessarily bad. If White captures Nc6 Black can recapture ...b7xc6 and have better central control. Perhaps Polgar is trying to take Kasparov out of familiar territory.",True,"

This comment explains the mistake because it suggests that capturing the knight on c6 might not have been the best choice for White, as Black has a potential response that can improve their central control.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"This makes Bf8 bad and doesn't prevent White from playing c2-c3, d2-d4 to open the center.",True,"

The comment correctly points out the mistake by highlighting that the move weakens the black's king's safety and allows white to open the center with pawn moves.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"
Already Black faces a crisis since White is better developed and Ke8 might soon be exposed.,True,"

The comment accurately describes a potential mistake related to the move, as it highlights the imbalance in development and hints at a weakness that could be exploited by White.",1. e4 c5 2.

"This could be the move of a complete amateur or of a great player such as Ivanchuk, but it seems out of place and unusual, for Polgar. This may be a small indication of an internal struggle wherein she tries to expand her approach, hopefully for the better. In this case I think it just fails.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by suggesting that it was unusual for the player, implying it might be a risk in her playing style that ended up being a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
Opening the center is more important than the pawn he appears to be gambitting.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as opening the center is a fundamental strategic principle in chess, and gambitting a pawn on a half-open file (the bishop's pawn opening) could be a mistake if it compromises the center.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
"practically begging for ...d6-d5, so he can open the e-file with exd5",True,"

The comment accurately points out the weakness in the player's move, allowing for a direct pawn push to open the e-file and create attacking chances.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5.

"Developing this piece to this square is usually normal, but in this case it's very strange. It helps keep the e-file blocked, but how are the king-side pieces to be developed and used? I'm not certain what Black's plan might be.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it raises concerns about the unconventional piece development and the potential limitations it imposes on the player's king-side pieces, indicating a lack of understanding of the opponent's strategy.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12.

"This position doesn't look too good for Black, but Na3 is misplaced and Nd6 is far from coordinating with other White pieces.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake by noting that the move Na3 is misplaced and does not coordinate well with the other White pieces.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12. Nba3 Be7 13. e5 d5 14. Nd6+ Kf8,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8"
"Kasparov just holds onto Nd6 and keeps an eye on how Black is going to proceed, looking for ways to gain advantage.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake; it only describes Kasparov's move strategy.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10.

Pd5 is in danger of being captured by Na3-b5-c3xd5 and I don't see a very good defense for Black.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the tactical threat to the Black pawn on d5, which is indeed vulnerable to a series of White's moves leading to a checkmate or significant material loss.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12. Nba3 Be7 13. e5 d5 14. Nd6+ Kf8 15. Bf4 h5 16. b4 c4 17.

"White takes over the center while Black squirms out of the corner. Is this sufficient to prevent White from crashing through the center? Well, first of all Pa7 is en prise, so White has to decide whether there is time to capture it and then return to the main theme.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the potential mistake of taking over the center without considering the exposed pawn and the need to reassess the overall strategy.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12. Nba3 Be7 13. e5 d5 14. Nd6+ Kf8 15. Bf4 h5 16. b4 c4 17. Qxd4 h4 18.

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made; it merely suggests that Black's position is currently stable.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8.

"perhaps considering ...Bd8-b6, but also clearing e7 to develop Ng8-e7-g6",True,"

The comment accurately describes a strategic decision to play...Bd8-b6, which aims to control the center while also preparing to develop the knight to g6, indicating a thoughtful alternative move that was missed.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12. Nba3 Be7 13. e5 d5 14. Nd6+ Kf8 15. Bf4 h5 16. b4 c4 17. Qxd4 h4 18. Nab5 Rh5 19.

"This position requires a comment. It appears Black has secured her king, but there's more of interest here. Black's advanced king-side pawns might give her a chance for some offense while it's not really clear White has any offense at all. The only factor which makes the position really murky is the blocked center. White has more space and Qd7 is dreadful, but can White actually penetrate Black's position? White can advance his queen-side pawns, but the king-side seems to be in Black's hands! This is an amazing realization to make after that peculiar opening. Perhaps a classicist would simply indicate that the immediate position doesn't appear winning for White, but Black will be compelled to make more moves and in so doing will unravel. We'll see.",False,"

The comment on the mistake does not explain the quality of the move but rather provides a strategic analysis of the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5.

"chasing White's queen away from control of d4, so ...Bb6 can't be met by Nc6-d4",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player as it identifies the potential loss of control over the d4 square and the difficulty in meeting...Bb6 with Nc6-d4.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3.

The comment implies the move made by the player was unrealistic or highly improbable, indicating a mistake in the move's evaluation.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5.

"Though Polgar has a rook on the h-file he would rather crouch behind the pawns than be flushed out to f1, or worse e2.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by Polgar as it highlights her choice to keep her rook protected behind pawns rather than advancing it, which could have been a stronger move in that particular position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 6. c3 g5 7. d4 g4 8. Nfd2 cxd4 9. cxd4 exd4 10. Nc4 c5 11. Re1 Be6 12. Nba3 Be7 13. e5 d5 14. Nd6+ Kf8 15. Bf4 h5 16. b4 c4 17. Qxd4 h4 18. Nab5 Rh5 19.

"She wants to bring Qd7 to the h-file and/or to use ...f5-f4 to chase away Bg3, but king safety is the first priority! Allowing exf6 is extremely risky. If only there was another way, but I see none. I suppose this is where the classicist says, ""I told you so."" Black is having difficult with Qd7 because White dominates in the center, cramping Black quite a lot.

"This is a marvelous situation: Bf7 is pinned, Nh8 is stuck defending Bf7 and Qh7 & Rh5 can only sit on the h-file, but they can't open it. White has completely foiled Black's plan, but at a cost.
