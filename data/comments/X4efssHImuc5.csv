"Moscow Variation -- After this White will either establish a white square pawn formation (Pc4, Pe4) to replace the effect of the bishop (to the extent they can) or aim for c2-c3, d2-d4 and possibly d4-d5 or e4-e5.

Black's advanced king-side pawns might give her a chance for some offense while it's not really clear White has any offense at all.

White can advance his queen-side pawns, but the king-side seems to be in Black's hands! This is an amazing realization to make after that peculiar opening.

"Though Polgar has a rook on the h-file he would rather crouch behind the pawns than be flushed out to f1, or worse e2.",True,"

"Getting rid of the rooks makes good sense, as it makes the advance of Pg2 & Ph2 much easier.",True,"
