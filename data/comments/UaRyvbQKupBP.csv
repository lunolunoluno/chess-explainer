"Timman spent more than 40 minutes on this move. In the old Boyd book, the c- pawn was advanced rather than exchanged. 14.c5 a5 15.c6 axb4 16.Nxb5 Nc5 17.Qxb4 Rxa2 The position is complicated, and much to my liking. 14.exf5 gxf5 15.Ng3 Nf4 Now if White captures at f4, then I would recapture with the pawn and open up the diagonal for my bishop.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic consideration for a recapture.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"This was actually the first new move of the game. Some authorities think that 15.Kb2 would have given White a clear advantage, but this is an opinion that neither I nor Jan Timman would agree with. 15.Kb2 Nb6 So what is wrong with Black's position? Surely it is too dangerous to capture the b-pawn.",True," The comment highlights a debatable tactical assessment, suggesting a potential missed opportunity.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

"A consistent move which plans to bring the rooks to the a-file. Some critics think that White should have sunk his knight into a7, headed for c6.

"Several commentators attacked this move, most unfairly, as it turns out. Is it the best possible move? That is not clear.

"This was a major error. White should have moved his king to comparative safety at b1. Then it would not be clear whether I could win, or whether I even had an advantage.
