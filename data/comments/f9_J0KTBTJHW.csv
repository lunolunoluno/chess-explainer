Way back in 1983 the moves 5...Nd4 and 5...b5 looked worthwhile. I wonder what current theory says.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, but rather hints at potential historical evaluation of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nd4,"This is a game between Grimmer, A W. (as White) and Stewart, D J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d4",-

Incredibly all of White's 10 or so moves have been forced! - now he's quite lost!,True,"

I'm sure I enjoyed that one!,True,"

The comment, ""I'm sure I enjoyed that one!"" is sarcastic and implies that the move was a mistake, as such a comment would not be made in a serious evaluation of a chess move.",1. e4 e5 2.
