"This is more aggressive than 3. Nf3, but it also offers Black more choices for defense. Common responses are 3...c5, 3...e5 or 3...Nf6. All of them challenge White's central pawns immediately. There were a couple of these played in the FIDE wch match of Ivanchuk and Ponomariov. If White is allowed time to develop pieces to support his pawns then Black would have real problems. It's essential to know precisely what White's pawn formation is, so that Black's developments will be most effective.

"Black too does some non-classical things: moving knights multiple times and now weakening Ke8 with ...f7-f5. It's often difficult to explain the rationale for such play. In this case Black can't get Bc8 developed as early as he'd like, so he uses Pf5 to control light squares. Black has to stake out control of the light squares to fix White's central pawns in place, then the assault on them would begin. This also explains why Black doesn't move ...Nb4-d5. He needs to leave open the possibility of ...c7-c5xd4, so control of d5 is sufficient; he doesn't have to occupy the square.",True," The comment provides a plausible explanation for the move's complexity and the resulting strategic goals, suggesting a potential misjudgement.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5.

"This is a dramatic change of the landscape. White doesn't continue with the central pawns now that he's gained a concession (king's weakness) from Black. Now piece play can become prevalent.

"Black immediately moves the bishop again, but White has moved his bishop twice also. And, who should be concerned about how many times a piece has moved after all the other peculiar-looking maneuvers which preceded this?

"Finally (!) , there's the crucial strike at Pd4. Of course it's different than if it had occurred early in the game. But, opening the position and getting rid of another White pawn will leave White with an isolated pawn, a much easier target.

Black has to prevent c3-c4 and in so doing offers a pawn trade which would give White a slightly better bishop (after 24. Qxb5 Qxd5 25.

"If Ponomariov had the White pieces he might well have played the same move. Both these players will go to extremes, at times, to gain the initiative for their pieces.
