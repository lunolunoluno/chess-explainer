"This is more aggressive than 3. Nf3, but it also offers Black more choices for defense. Common responses are 3...c5, 3...e5 or 3...Nf6. All of them challenge White's central pawns immediately. There were a couple of these played in the FIDE wch match of Ivanchuk and Ponomariov. If White is allowed time to develop pieces to support his pawns then Black would have real problems. It's essential to know precisely what White's pawn formation is, so that Black's developments will be most effective. If White can keep his pawns as a duo they might advance in any fashion to foil Black's early developments.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential aggressive nature of the move, mentioning common defensive responses, and emphasizing the importance of understanding White's pawn formation to counter effectively.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
"Now Black knows not to fianchetto either bishop. Instead ...Bc8-e6-d5 followed by ...e7-e6, ...c7-c5 and ...Nb8-c6 would be coherent and apply terrific pressure to White's central pawns. Incidentally Pd4 isn't en prise because 6...Qxd4 is met decisively by 7. Bb5+.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting a better move that would put pressure on White's central pawns and highlighting the vulnerability of the rook pawn.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3"
White's early pawn advances and Bishop developments creates a curious appearance and flaunts the classical rule of developing knights before bishops.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it only criticizes the player's development choices, not the specific move made.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"
"Black too does some non-classical things: moving knights multiple times and now weakening Ke8 with ...f7-f5. It's often difficult to explain the rationale for such play. In this case Black can't get Bc8 developed as early as he'd like, so he uses Pf5 to control light squares. Black has to stake out control of the light squares to fix White's central pawns in place, then the assault on them would begin. This also explains why Black doesn't move ...Nb4-d5. He needs to leave open the possibility of ...c7-c5xd4, so control of d5 is sufficient; he doesn't have to occupy the square.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it outlines the strategic rationale behind the non-traditional moves, highlighting the need to control light squares and prevent White from fixing their central pawns.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
"This is a dramatic change of the landscape. White doesn't continue with the central pawns now that he's gained a concession (king's weakness) from Black. Now piece play can become prevalent. White would probably like to play Qd1-h5+, but he can't afford to until he's hobbled Nb4. It threatens to jump into c2 if White walks away from that square.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the consequences of the move and the potential threats it creates for White.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f6"
Consistently Black uses a pawn to block Be4 and this incidentally (and usefully) prevents Qd1-h5+ from being effective. Now Nb4 could retreat if necessary.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies a strategic mistake, acknowledging the pawn's role in blocking the bishop's activity and the potential for a queen attack, and also mentions a possible retreat move for the knight, providing a comprehensive evaluation.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
It doesn't look like any stodgy closed Queen's Gambit Declined!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it simply comments on the lack of a specific opening variation being played, rather than addressing the quality or impact of the move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"
"Black immediately moves the bishop again, but White has moved his bishop twice also. And, who should be concerned about how many times a piece has moved after all the other peculiar-looking maneuvers which preceded this? Most importantly Black threatens Bg5 and keeps Ke8 safe.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the unnecessary movement of the bishop and points out the threat of Bg5 and the safety of Ke8.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7"
Now who's lost the tempo?,True,". The comment ""Now who's lost the tempo?"" implies that the player made a move which allowed their opponent to gain an advantage in the pace of the game, often resulting in a strategic disadvantage.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d2"
"Oddly, the position closely resembles one arising from a Petrov's Defense.",True,"

The comment identifies a strategic mistake, suggesting the player may have overlooked a common defense, which indicates a lack of precision or foresight.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d5"
"It's a sad day for White when he has to trade his good bishop for a lowly knight, and Black continues his light square control.",True,"

The comment accurately criticizes the move for trading a strategically valuable bishop for a less impactful knight, and it correctly points out Black's advantage in maintaining control over the light squares.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c4"
"Well, at least he gets the bishop back. This simplifies the game considerably and White's multiple pawn ""islands"" is balanced to some extent by Black's slightly weakened king's position.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player as it acknowledges the recapture of the bishop, which may have been a blunder, and compares the simplified position with the balance in pawn structures and the weakened king's position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21. Nxf7,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f7"
"Finally (!) , there's the crucial strike at Pd4. Of course it's different than if it had occurred early in the game. But, opening the position and getting rid of another White pawn will leave White with an isolated pawn, a much easier target. This is an example of attacking the pawn chain at it's head, Nimcovics (Nimzovitch) wouldn't have given this as an example of excellent play, but he also played such things.",True,"

The annotation correctly identifies the mistake by explaining the strategic implications of opening the position and leaving White with an isolated pawn, which could be exploited by Black.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21. Nxf7 Rxf7 22. Qb3 c5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
If White gets time for c3-c4 he'll have made Bf6 worse by blocking Pc5 which blocks Be7. It also removes the pawns from dark squares where they're targets.,True,"

The comment accurately highlights the strategic disadvantages of the move, including blocking important squares for the bishop and pawns, as well as the potential loss of tempo.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21. Nxf7 Rxf7 22. Qb3 c5 23. d5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d5"
Black has to prevent c3-c4 and in so doing offers a pawn trade which would give White a slightly better bishop (after 24. Qxb5 Qxd5 25. Bf4) if he can target Bc5 without ...f5-f4 chasing it off the e3-c5 diagonal.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the Black player in terms of the consequences of the move, specifically regarding the potential pawn trade and the resulting positional advantage for White.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21. Nxf7 Rxf7 22. Qb3 c5 23. d5 b5,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"
"If Ponomariov had the White pieces he might well have played the same move. Both these players will go to extremes, at times, to gain the initiative for their pieces. In this case Black can work to isolate Pd5 and block Qb3 over on the queen-side, several tempi from the central action.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake as it indicates the positional weaknesses caused by the move and suggests a counter-strategy for the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21.

"This particular simplification has left the weakness of Kg8 more noticable, but Black's incursion at Qd2 which threatens Pc3 is consistent with his plan to make something of the extra queen-side pawn. The balance is still there.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to focus more on Black's strategy rather than addressing the specific error made by the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21.

Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on d2"
He can afford this because Pc3 is poison.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake, as Pc3 (pawn on c3) is indeed a weak and vulnerable position, often referred to as being ""poisoned,"" which can be easily targeted by the opponent's pieces.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5.

Black wants a queen trade to end the threats to Kf8. That would make it easier for him to redirect attention to his queen-side pawns.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake because it does not address a specific error in the move played but rather suggests a general strategy for Black.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21.

The attack on Kf8 has to take a break and this move prevents Black from putting his Pa7 into motion.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by explaining how the move limits Black's pawn mobility, which could be a strategic error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nb4 8. Be4 f5 9. exf6 exf6 10. Nc3 f5 11. Bb1 N4d5 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bd2 O-O 15. O-O Nxc3 16. bxc3 Be6 17. Re1 Bd5 18. Bd3 Nc4 19. Bxc4 Bxc4 20. Ne5 Bf7 21. Nxf7 Rxf7 22.

Apparently he doesn't want to just repeat moves; but this is risky.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only refers to a desire to avoid repetition, not the specifics of the error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5.

White prefers to make something of his ability to threaten (or at least to check) Black's king with queen & rook.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting that White should have utilized their queen and rook to create a threat against Black's king, instead of making a less effective move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5.

"Trading rooks is difficult to avoid, but it limits White's attacking chances. There are few positions where a queen can checkmate the opponent king by itself. However, it can perpetually check.",True,"

The comment appropriately explains that trading rooks limits White's attacking chances, indicating that the previous move was a mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6.
