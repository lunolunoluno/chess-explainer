The Dutch defense is becoming less and less used in masterplay due to evolving opening theory and refuting ideas.

"Bb4+? Unnecessarily restrictive. The simple 2/\Nf6 was called for or setting up the stonewall formationwith 2/\d5 with 3/\c6 to follow. TheStonewall is well-known as an (+)Anti-computer[+] defense because the positionstend to be reliant on long term positional maneuvering and not quick tacticalflares.. This allows white a free handin the center to push to e4 and increase his spatial advantage and to openlines to use his superior development. The text is easily refuted with 3. Nc3 where any exchange on c3 can only benefit white. Bd2 Bxd2?! Not the best continuation here either. Much more logical is 3/\Qe7, when 4. g3 Nf65. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 and only now Bxd2 where black doesn/^t stand nearly as badly. The text relinquishes Black/^scontrol of the center as well as speed in development.

"A good decis ion. Tobe considered as stronger, however, is 5. g3 with a kingside fianchettogradually building up the position. Attempts to retain the initiative with 5. d5 Nce7 6. dxe6 dxe6 onlysucceed in helping black mobilize. Opening the position early like this without the development to back it up can lead to disaster.

"The first blunder. The e-file was already white/ ^s avenue of attack as long as the blackking is in the center. Weakening thee-file for white even further does not help matters. Not only is the e-pawn weak, but the king is weak! Much better was the obvious 7/\Nf6 with acastle kingside. Nc5?! A questionable move. Certainly the knight cannot establish himself here. It would seem as though this warrior wouldlike to fight on black/ ^s weak side of the board, the kingside. 7. Ng3 would be begging to be played. Now, Black can solidify with 7/\Nge7! 7/\Nge7 kept things together in excellent order for blackwith the idea of 0-0 and Nf5 followed by Qd6 solidifying with chances. Also, eventual e5 advances would begin to become feasible. There/^s no reason to immediately chase the knight away from its post. Nb3 Bb7? A blunder. Black may feel obligated to play that move because of b6, however it is imperative thathe castle as soon as possible. Therefore, 8/\Nge7! with the idea of 0-0 Nf5 and Nce7 would be indicatedfor Black. Another possible move, evenmore aggressive perhaps, is 8/\Qf6!? threatening Nge7 with even stronger forceas the ideas dxc4 followed by Nd5 are now possible. After the text white can pick which side of the board to play on(queenside, center, kingside) as he has prospects in each area.",True," The comment provides specific reasoning for the mistake, highlighting a missed opportunity and a flawed tactical assessment.",1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4 d5,This is a game between W40 (as White) and B40 (as Black).

"White could choose to play in the center which would revolvearound attacking the e-pawn and controlling the e-file most like starting withideas like 9. Qe2. White could chooseto play on the queenside (now that black played b6) because of the ideainvolved with 9. c5! (making the b7 bishop look pretty ridiculous) and Rc1, a strongidea, with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the kingside where black/^s king remains open. Moves such as 9. Bd3 come to mind. D2 is a poor square for the queen as she is not involved inany real plan and she/^s exposed to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4) etc. Passivity resembles this move. Black still does have to deal with thesomewhat distant threat of Bd3 followed by Ng5 with a fork on the h and epawns. However, intending Ng5 so theknight can be protected from the queen at d2 is a poor reason to play themove. With correct play, Black could/^vepounced on this. Allows white to develop with tempo with subsequent pressureon the new isolated e-pawn. It/^s toobig of a trade-off between all these cons and the one and only pro of morebishop activity. 9/ \Nf6! was the indicatedmove. Bxc4 Here, it doesn/^t take a Garry Kasparov or Vishy Anand to seethat white is well ahead in position. Space advantage, more piece mobility, a lead in development, attackingchances, the list could go on and on. The main trump black holds is the long diagonal and the d-file. But use of these means doesn/^t leave as goodof impression as White/^s. In an inferior position, Black picks the worst way possibleto defend the pawn. 10/ \Qf6 would/^vebeen indicated. Ng5! I personally would/^ve castled kingside first to increasepressure with Re1 as well, but one can hardly call the text an error. A game-losing blunder. If Black intended to sacrifice the isolated e-pawn, he should/^ve done sowith 11/\Nf6. Now the position becomeswide open and tactics loom left and right. Only the better developed, fully-mobilized side can profit from this.",True," The comment offers a detailed analysis of a potentially flawed move, highlighting strategic weaknesses and suggesting alternative approaches.",1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nc6 3. e4 d5 4.
