I was playing safe when faced with a novelty but this move is also solid tacticaly and positionaly.,True,"

Kb1,"This is a game between Thomson, Thomas (as White) and Stull, Norbert (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to b1"," White played a move that, while seemingly cautious, actually missed a potential strong tactical and positional advantage."
Black would like to follow this up with ...b4.,True,"

With the idea of Qe5.,True,"

The comment indicates that the previous move was a mistake because it suggests an ineffective or illogical strategy (""with the idea of Qe5""), implying that the move was a poor choice in the context of the game.",1. e4 c5 2.

Last move played: White plays Knight takes on e6", 'White's attempt with Qe5 lacks strategic depth and might not be as effective as anticipated.'
This is desperate but it allows Black to live in hope for a while. White still has work to do.,True,"

The comment justifies the move by indicating that it is a last resort that gives Black a temporary advantage, suggesting that the move made by White might be a strategic sacrifice.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. f5 Nc5 14. f6 gxf6 15. gxf6 Bf8 16. Rg1 h5 17. a3 Bd7 18. Bh3 Rc8 19.
