Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 Bb4 5. Qc2 O-O 6. Nd5 a5 7. a3 Bc5 8. Ng5,"This is a game between Atienza, Hilario (as White) and Enev, Zlatko (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g5"
"Not letting the bishop be exchanged. Although it did not do much of anything in the actual game, some variations later proved this decision has been right.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake made because it states that the player's decision was right in some variations, which contradicts the claim that it was a mistake.",1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3.

still keeping the position equal,False,"

Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6"
"white stays a little bit better, I think",False,"

Nd5 a5 7. a3 Bc5 8. Ng5 g6 9. Nxf6+ Qxf6 10. Ne4 Qe7 11. b3 Ba7 12. Bb2 d6 13. Ng3 f5 14. Be2 Be6 15. O-O f4 16. Ne4 Bf5 17.
