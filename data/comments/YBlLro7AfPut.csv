Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3 Ne7,"I have to admit that I'm not well-versed in the theory of this variation with 9.Nd5 instead of 9.Bxf6, but I know enough that this move causes me to sit up and pay attention. The idea of the 9.Nd5 line, as I understand it, is that black cannot get away with challenging the knight this easily. Presumably the kingside weaknesses are too much if black is also without his dark-squared bishop. But black says: ""show me"".",True

Bd3,"The bishop often stays put for a long time in these lines, so this isn't an obvious case of ""finish development, get castled"",... especially if you see how white continues! Regarding development of the bishop to d3 in general - it is meant to be prophylactic, I think, against ...d5 and ...f5, but white has to show some care in that the bishop can find itself misplaced if black gets an opportunity to play ...f5 as a sac and then start rolling the center.",True

Actually, looking over this game a second time around, this seems very logical. If you read my notes to last week's game, you might even agree that this is a ""reaction"" move agaist 14...d5, the possibility of which white has cleverly kept open, but, but... the Na3 is supposed to go to the center, white is supposed to play a4 to activate the a1-rook, etc. Patterns can be useful, but they can be limiting as well. Apparently Nisipeanu is less susceptible to being limited by patterns than I am.",True

One possible modification to note, however, is that if white keeps the knights on the board, this may prove useful to tickle the weak a6 and c6 squares around black's king.",False

For these reasons I would be tempted not to look at it at all. But after you see it, it becomes clear that 28. Na6 is the winning move, since in this case white's rook penetrates and becomes unanswerable after the slightly tricky knight exchange.",True
