"After Kasparov and Ponomariov used c2-c4 Anand used Nb1-c3, but Bf1-d3 (Kan Variation) , used by Ivanchuk in round 10 (he also followed with c2-c4 after he'd castled) , is supposed to be the ""main line"".

This is typical of a Paulsen Variation. Black leaves open his specific piece development and just uses pawn moves early-on to limit White's pieces.

"Adams saw that Rf1 had no great offensive value if it was always going to be traded for Rf8, so he forced the trade on his terms.

There's the completion of the pawn exchange. Now White has an extra pawn and Black has a slightly weak doubled h-file pawn.

Adams plays as though he had Pc2 rather than Pc4. This tells me he considers having Pc4 as an unqualified advantage which requires no limitation on how he might otherwise play the position.
