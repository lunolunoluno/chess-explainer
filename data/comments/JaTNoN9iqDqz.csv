"Fischer plays simply. Alternatively, after 8.Nd2 Nf6 9.Qe2, White plays for the attack, but Black has queenside and central chances.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake, as it suggests that Fischer missed a tactical opportunity to launch an attack on the kingside while still maintaining options for queenside and central play.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"
"Petrosian probably didn't like 10...Nxd5 because of 11.Be4 and now 11...Bb7 12.Qb3 is unpleasant, intending Rf1-d1 and Nb1-c3, while 12.Nc3 is also possible. { Petrosian thought 10...Qxd5 was best, but after 11.Nc3, White is two tempos ahead and should be able to exploit this.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential disadvantages of Black's move 10...Nxd5 and suggesting better alternatives.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d5"
This is a very unpleasant check.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it suggests the player's move has resulted in a check, potentially leaving the player's king in a vulnerable position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to a4 with check"
"After 12...Bd7 13.Qc2, White has some pressure, but after 13...0-0 14.Bg5 h6 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nxd5, chessplayers these days would not be so afraid of having this position with Black - Black has the bishop pair, but Fischer knew Petrosian didn't like to sacrifice pawns, so he believed Petrosian wouldn't even consider this line.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out that the player missed the opportunity to create dynamic counterplay and pressure after sacrificing the pawn on f6, which could have potentially led to a better position for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d7"
"Very simple - pinning the bishop on e7. If 13.Bb5 axb5 14.Qxa8 0-0, when Black can continue with Bc8-b7, and d5-d4, when Black is better developed with a strong passed d-pawn, and the White queen is out of play.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it identifies the pinning of the bishop on e7 and outlines the consequences for White, including the potential for Black to gain a significant advantage through development and pawn structure.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1"
"If 13...d4 14.Nb5 0-0 15.Qxd4 axb5 16.Qxd7 Bxd7 17.Rxe7, or 13...0-0? 14.Qxd7 Bxd7 15.Rxe7 and White is winning.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that after the move 13...d4, White has a winning position with the moves 14.Nb5, 0-0, 15.Qxd4, axb5, 16.Qxd7, Bxd7, 17.Rxe7.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on a4"
The position is almost equal but Fischer shows good technique in this position.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it instead acknowledges the quality of Fischer's technique in the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6"
"If 15...Nd7 16.f4 g6 17.Rac1 0-0 18.Bd4, intending 19.f5 gxf5 20.Bxf5 Bxf5 21.Rxe7, etc.",True,"

The comment adequately explains the mistake made by the player as it identifies the strategic error in the move sequence, suggesting a more aggressive continuation for White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle"
Fixing the a-pawn and preparing Na4-c5.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out the need to fix the a-pawn and preparing for a future move, Na4-c5, indicating a potential weakness or an opportunity in the opponent's position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b4"
Freeing the pin on the e-file.,False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake as it does not refer to a specific move or its consequences.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8"
Taking the e4- and g4-squares away from the Black knight.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that the move taken by the player removed the ability of the Black knight to control the e4 and g4 squares, potentially weakening the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8 19. Nc5 Bc8 20. f3,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"
Intending Bd7-b5.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the attempted mistake of the player by planning to move the bishop from d7 to b5, which could be a strategic error depending on the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

"Given two exclamation marks by Petrosian. An incredible move - Fischer surrenders his strong knight for Black's bad bishop, but as we shall see - Fischer knew quite well what he was doing! Nowadays all players would consider playing 22.a4 with a big advantage.",False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by Fischer; it misattributes the move to Petrosian when it was actually by Fischer.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8 19. Nc5 Bc8 20. f3 Rea7 21. Re5 Bd7 22. Nxd7+,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on d7 with check"
Threatening Bd3xa6 or Rc1-c6.,False,"

The comment does not explain why the move was a mistake; it only suggests potential threats.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8 19. Nc5 Bc8 20. f3 Rea7 21. Re5 Bd7 22. Nxd7+ Rxd7 23. Rc1,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to c1"
Fischer loved the R + B vs R + N endings.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it only provides information about a type of endgame (R + B vs R + N) that the player might have a preference for, rather than addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to d6"
"In principle this is bad because after h2-h4, White would eventually get another passed pawn in most endings with g2-g4. If 26...Re8 27.Rxe8+ Kxe8 28.Rc8+ Ke7 29.Ra8 Ne5 30.Bxa6, White has an extra pawn, and most probably nothing will happen for Black, for example: 30...d4 31.Ke2 d3+ 32.Kd2 and White is easily winning.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic implications of the mistake made by White, highlighting the potential gain of an extra pawn and the likely outcome in favor of White in various continuations.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5"
Also good is 27.h4.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it does not specifically refer to the move in question, which is presumably 26.Qe6, and instead refers to a different move, 27.h4.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17.

Ke3 d4+,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d4 with check"
If 33...Nxf4 34.Bc4 winning.,True,"

The comment correctly points out a tactical blunder by the opponent, as it shows that after the move 33...Nxf4, the white player can win material with 34.Bc4.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8 19.

Rb7 Nxb4,"This is a game between Fischer, R (as White) and Petrosian, T (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on b4"
"Because after 34...Rc8 35.Rfe7+ Kf8, 36.Rh7 leads to mate by force. After defeating Petrosian, only the World Champion Spassky was left on Fischer's road to the chess title.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it describes the forced sequence of moves leading to checkmate.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 8. c4 Nf6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Re1 Qxa4 14. Nxa4 Be6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Bc5 Rfe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. b4 Kf8 19. Nc5 Bc8 20. f3 Rea7 21. Re5 Bd7 22. Nxd7+ Rxd7 23.
