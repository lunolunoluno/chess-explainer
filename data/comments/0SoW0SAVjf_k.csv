"This rarely adopted variation transfers to the second player the attack, which is, however, a short-lived one if properly defended.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the player made a mistake by adopting a rarely used variation which transfers the attack to the second player but warns that it is only a temporary advantage if not properly defended.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4"," 'This move by Black places them in a precarious position, quickly evading the attack but difficult to maintain.'"
"This sacrifice of the knight is a novel introduction. 5...d4 is generally preferred at this point, and is usually continued thus: 5...d4 6.exf6 dxc3 7.b3 Qxf6 8.Nf3 Bg4 9.Be2 Nc6 etc., and most practitioners pronounce the game even.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it compares the chosen move (5...d4) to the more commonly played and accepted line in this position, implying that the move deviates from the norm and potentially weakens the position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 5. fxe5 Nxe4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on e4", The knight sacrifice isn't a typical choice. 5...d4 is usually followed by 5...d4 6.exf6 dxc3 7.b3 Qxf6 8.Nf3 Bg4 9.Be2 Nc6 and many chess experts would consider the game unsound.
"The saving clause which redeems White's game, and leaves the opponent no option but to lose a move with the only piece he has got in play besides his queen.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player as it highlights the consequences of the move, which was to force the opponent into losing a crucial move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 5. fxe5 Nxe4 6. dxe4 Qh4+ 7. Ke2 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Bg4+ 9. Nf3 dxe4 10. Qd4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d4", Black's last move of playing the queen to d4 puts White in a precarious position. This move doesn't offer any real advantage or safety. It leaves White with no beneficial options and essentially forces them to lose a move with their only other piece in play besides the queen.
"Black would have lost a piece if he had taken the knight with the pawn checking, for White would have simply retaken with the pawn, and Black would have been compelled to sacrifice the pinned bishop for the adverse f-pawn, and then White's king would have easily reached a safe goal after a few checks from the opponent.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by outlining the sequence of events that would occur if the pawn had been taken with the knight, resulting in Black losing a piece.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 5. fxe5 Nxe4 6. dxe4 Qh4+ 7. Ke2 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Bg4+ 9. Nf3 dxe4 10. Qd4 Bh5,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to h5"," Black would have lost a piece after playing Bxg8, as White could recapture with the pawn, forcing Black to sacrifice their bishop, which would then allow White's king to safely secure a position with some checks."
"A number of ingenious traps were laid for White by Black's last move. Had he now moved 11. Kd2, the reply would have been 11...Qg4; and if White attacked the queen by 12. h3, Black would have checked with the queen at f4, followed by 13...Qg3+, if 13.Ke1 or, in the other alternative, if 13.Kd1, he would have won, by 13... exf3, followed by 14...fxg2+, in answer to 14.Bxf4 etc. Again, if White now moved 11.Kd1 at once, Black might have sacrificed the queen by 11...exf3; for, if 12.Qxh4 in reply, he could also proceed to leave the bishop en prise by 12.. .fxg2+, winning the rook and making a new queen.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player, as it provides a detailed analysis of the potential consequences of White's previous move, showing that Black had a strong counter and presenting multiple possibilities for Black's plan.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 5. fxe5 Nxe4 6. dxe4 Qh4+ 7. Ke2 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Bg4+ 9. Nf3 dxe4 10. Qd4 Bh5 11. Ke3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to e3"," White's last move was inadequate, risking a series of advantageous counterattacks. If White played 11. Kd2, Black could respond with 11...Qg4. Should White then advance with 12. h3, Black could exploit the aggression by checking the White king with Qf4. After 13...Qg3+, White is in a precarious position. If White moves the king to 13. Ke1, the situation remains tense. However, with 13. Kd1, Black has a winning opportunity, capturing the knight with 13...exf3. Following up with 14...fxg2+ would leave White in a losing position, unable to defend effectively. Furthermore, if White opted for 11. Kd1 right away, Black has a queen sacrifice option with 11...exf3. This would set up a checkmate threat with 12. Qxh4, and upon 12...fxg2+, Black could capture the rook and continue with 14...fxg2+, leading to a decisive advantage."
"The only move to prevent an immediate draw, which Black would have obtained by checking backwards and forwards with the queen at e1 and h4, if White had captured the bishop at once with the pawn. White wished to avoid thatcontingenc y, relying upon his king getting into the middle of the board, ready to support the pawns of both wings, if he succeeded in exchanging queens, which would be more favorable to him in the endgame.",True,"

The annotation clearly explains the strategy behind the move, including avoiding a draw with a back-and-forth queen check and positioning for a potential queen exchange for an advantageous endgame.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 5. fxe5 Nxe4 6. dxe4 Qh4+ 7. Ke2 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Bg4+ 9. Nf3 dxe4 10. Qd4 Bh5 11. Ke3 Bxf3 12. Bb5+,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Blackburne, Joseph (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5 with check"," This move was a mistake because White hoped to avoid a draw by capturing the Bishop with the pawn early on. Instead, White decided to let the Bishop stay, aiming to position their king to assist pawns on both sides if a queen exchange occurred. This could potentially favor White in the endgame."
"Much superior to exchanging queens at once, whereupon White would have retaken with the king. White's king is now driven more to the rear and the exchange can be afforded more conveniently on the next move. If White in reply move 15.f4, Black would obtain a good game by 15...Nc6.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, highlighting the strategic disadvantage of exchanging queens and how it allowed White to recapture with the king, making the exchange less favorable for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

"[?:??-1:00] Black could not afford to allow the bishop to be planted at d6, and the sacrifice of the pawn was quite judicious under the circumstances that White's material advantage consisted afterwards in a doubled pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by Black, as sacrificing the pawn on d6 allowed White to gain material advantage through a doubled pawn structure.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b4"," [?] Black's decision to move their pawn to b4 was a strategic misstep, as it allowed White's bishop to be effectively placed on d6, weakening their position."
"Taking the c-pawn would have led to an exchange disadvantageous to Black, e.g. : 20...Qxc3 21.Qxc3 Rxc3 22.Rxb7 Rxc2+ 23.Ke3, and wins the a-pawn.",True,"

At this point, if White captures the pawn with 23.Ke3, Black will be left with a winning rook on c2.

"The counter attack looked promising at first sight; but 23...Rc5, with the object of castling, was in reality safer play.
