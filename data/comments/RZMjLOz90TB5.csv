"It could be argued the ideal pawn formation for Black is with ...d7-d6 and ...g7-g6 as in a Dragon or with ...e7-e6 and ...b7-b6 as in a Queen's Indian Defense. Both and everything else between are played. I've played the Najdorf and Scheveningen variations, but can easily see the advantages of the Dragon too. I haven't been too fond of 2...e6 because there's no added control of square e5, but that doesn't mean Black can't play ...Ng8-f6. 2...e6 serves a similar purpose to 1...e6 in a French Defense. It limits the scope of Bf1 and frees the way for Bf8 to develop.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic alternative to the Najdorf or Scheveningen.",1. e4 c5 2.

"In this Sicilian Variation Black grabs the d-pawn before it can ever serve to support e4-e5. Now, usually, White must use f2-f4 to support the e4-e5 advance.

"This normal developing move creates an interesting threat: ...Bf8-b4xc3 and ...Nf6xe4. White tends to disregard this as a threat, to some extent, because the weakening of Black's dark squares is compensation for doubled c-file pawns.

"This is a most unusual variation, not often played, but popular for a time in the 1980s. It was ""discussed"" several times in the Polugaevsky Memorial/Sicilian Love tournament, Buenos Aires 1994.
