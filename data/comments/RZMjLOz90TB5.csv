"It could be argued the ideal pawn formation for Black is with ...d7-d6 and ...g7-g6 as in a Dragon or with ...e7-e6 and ...b7-b6 as in a Queen's Indian Defense. Both and everything else between are played. I've played the Najdorf and Scheveningen variations, but can easily see the advantages of the Dragon too. I haven't been too fond of 2...e6 because there's no added control of square e5, but that doesn't mean Black can't play ...Ng8-f6. 2...e6 serves a similar purpose to 1...e6 in a French Defense. It limits the scope of Bf1 and frees the way for Bf8 to develop.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake by discussing the importance of pawn formation in response to their move, suggesting alternative formations and strategies that could have been used.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e6"
"In this Sicilian Variation Black grabs the d-pawn before it can ever serve to support e4-e5. Now, usually, White must use f2-f4 to support the e4-e5 advance. But, that isn't the only plan White can utilize. Instead White aims for general piece activity and freedom of movement to hit Black wherever he can.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by Black, as they prematurely advanced the d-pawn without adequately preparing the e4-e5 push, which is typical in this variation, and missing the opportunity for White to utilize their general piece activity.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d4"
Black's pawns limit White's knights and Be2. Black seeks to keep open options while discouraging White from any active operations.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the strategic disadvantage and the potential weakness created by the move, which could indeed be considered a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"
"This normal developing move creates an interesting threat: ...Bf8-b4xc3 and ...Nf6xe4. White tends to disregard this as a threat, to some extent, because the weakening of Black's dark squares is compensation for doubled c-file pawns. However, the loss of Pe4 requires more compensation.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential threat created by the move and the need for compensation due to the loss of the pawn.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
"This is a most unusual variation, not often played, but popular for a time in the 1980s. It was ""discussed"" several times in the Polugaevsky Memorial/Sicilian Love tournament, Buenos Aires 1994. White exploits the weak dark squares in exchange for Pe4. It might seem impossible, at this early stage, for this to be sufficient compensation for a pawn, but it has shown to be effective.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it provides a historical context and analysis of the move's rarity and potential advantages, indicating that the player may have underestimated these aspects.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to a4"
"With 9...Be7 Black has threatened ...Rb8xb2, but left Pe4. White's two bishops and freedom of movement should give him some lasting advantage. Whether Black can utilize Nf6 with advancing central pawns, meant to block White's pieces, is unclear.",True,"

The comment accurately explains Black's move as a mistake due to the threat of...Rb8xb2 and the loss of the pawn on e4, while also recognizing White's superior position with two bishops and more mobility.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on c8"
White threatens Bxf6 followed by Qxd7 and seems interested only in simple piece play -- tactical opportunism.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it identifies a tactical opportunity (Bxf6) that could be followed by a sequence of moves (Qxd7) to gain material or positional advantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to d1"
Black accepts that his pawns will be broken up and just improves the knight. From d5 it threatens ...Nd5-f4 to snare Be2 or ... Nd5-b4 to grab Pa2.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it merely states the threats posed by the knight after Black's move, without addressing why Black's decision to improve the knight was incorrect given the position's demands.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16.

Black obviously threatens ...c6-c5,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies a potential tactical opportunity for Black to advance their pawn to c5, which could threaten White's position in the game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Bf3 Rfd8 19. c4 Nf6,"This is a game between Shirov, Alexei (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"
White turns the tables a bit and threatens Bd4-e5 which either wins the exchange (Be5xb8) or forces ...Be7-d6 which allows Be5xf6 to win a pawn and weaken Kg8.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the consequences of the move, indicating a potential double threat that could either result in an exchange or a significant material advantage for White.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18.

"It's amazing he'd offer to trade king-side pawns when Black's pawns are split, leaving Ph7 very weak.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies a significant mistake by the player, as trading king-side pawns with Black's pawns split weakens the pawn structure and leaves the f7 square vulnerable.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18.

"White simply defends his pawn and ""asks"" Black if he can manage to do as well.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake, as the move made by White does not contribute to the game's strategy and allows Black to potentially exploit it.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Bf3 Rfd8 19. c4 Nf6 20.

"White has won the pawn, weakened Ph7 and now plans Bf3-e4 (where else could the bishop be of use?) .",True,"

The comment indicates that White has made a mistake by losing a pawn and weakening their pawn structure, which is typically a poor strategic move; the additional comment about the bishop's potential move suggests that the player's plan is compromised.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18.

White tries to get Bf3-e4 without allowing Black to undercut the effort by ...Rd8xd1.,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it highlights the key issue with the move and suggests a possible response from the opponent.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Bf3 Rfd8 19. c4 Nf6 20. Qc3 Bd6 21. g3 c5 22.

"preferring not to let White have a three-to-one queen-side pawn majority, even in exchange for a good passed central pawn",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as they prioritized maintaining a pawn structure balance over potentially gaining a better position or more material.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18.

clearing the d-file in preparation for ...Rb8-d8,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by pointing out that the player made a move aimed at clearing the d-file, which was a strategic blunder as it allowed for an upcoming...Rb8-d8.",1. e4 c5 2.

"but, White's king-side attack comes first",True,"

The comment suggests that the player made a mistake by prioritizing the king-side attack over a more immediate and beneficial action, indicating a lack of proper evaluation of the position.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9. Na4 Be7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Nb6 Rb8 12. Nxc8 Qxc8 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd3 Qc7 15. b3 a5 16. Rad1 d5 17. exd5 Nxd5 18.

courageous or risky? White threatens Qh5xh6 or Rg6xe6 with Bf3-d5 to follow.,True,"

The comment effectively highlights the potential threats Black has to consider if White proceeds with their plan, demonstrating the mistake made by White in underestimating Black's counterplay options.",1. e4 c5 2.

White has to pry the position open before Rg6 is completely trapped and lost.,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the player made a mistake by allowing the position to become overly restricted, which eventually led to the rook on g6 being significantly weakened and lost.",1. e4 c5 2.

"So, they've both survived the confusion and White has the extra pawn, but there are no queens and the bishops travel on different colors. Only the simple back rank mate threat is a concern.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move was a mistake due to the potential back rank mate threat.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be2 a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bb4 9.
