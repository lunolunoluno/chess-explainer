"This is not a particularly great move from the objective point of view. However, subjectively I think it is right. This avoids all of the well-traveled theory after 8.Qxg7 which, despite his rating, my opponent could easily look up. Here, even if my opponent knows to take the pawn, the position will become unbalanced and unfamiliar (to him). In such a position the likelihood of him playing timidly and badly is high.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential consequences of the move in terms of theory and opponent's possible playstyle.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3"," Despite being a subjective decision, Black's move could be considered suboptimal from an objective standpoint. It sidesteps established theory following 8.Qxg7, which even a lower-rated player might recognize. This move leads to an unfamiliar position for Black, which might result in hesitancy and poor play."
There it is.,False,"

The comment ""There it is."" is too vague and does not specify what the mistake was, making it ineffective in explaining the quality of the previously played move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Now white simply has more space, and has whatever chances exist on both sides of the board.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the consequence of the mistake, highlighting that white now has an advantage of more space and chances on both sides of the board.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d4"," Hartwig's pawn sacrifice on d4 provides Black with greater central control and more space. The move may seem disadvantageous for White in the short term, but it opens up strategic possibilities on both sides of the board."
"There are other plans, but this works excellently in the game. After 17...g6 black has no hopes of kingside counterplay.",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it focuses on the lack of kingside counterplay rather than the quality of the move itself.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

The comment ""I was hoping to see this!"" does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it seems to express surprise or anticipation rather than criticism or analysis.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"So far everything has gone excellently for white on the board and on the clock. Now, however, white has to be very precise. My great advantage is that black is tied, so I can choose when and where to strike. This would be no advantage if I strike at the wrong moment and simply release black's pieces. There is a phase where the momentum temporarily shifts in a chess game and the pressure is on the attacker to find the right continuation. This is it.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the quality of the move made by white, but rather comments on the overall strategy and pressure in the game, without specifying the mistake made by white.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Black defends well for the next few moves and doesn't get spooked. For example, I was hoping he might be nervous to play this after I had plonked my rook onto the b-file.",False,"
The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on the opponent's potential psychological response rather than the strategic or tactical errors in the move itself.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"My position is not yet so good that I didn't hope to take advantage of my opponent's time trouble.
