"This is not a particularly great move from the objective point of view. However, subjectively I think it is right. This avoids all of the well-traveled theory after 8.Qxg7 which, despite his rating, my opponent could easily look up. Here, even if my opponent knows to take the pawn, the position will become unbalanced and unfamiliar (to him). In such a position the likelihood of him playing timidly and badly is high.",True, The comment highlights a strategic flaw – avoiding well-trodden theory – which directly contributes to the mistake.,1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"So far everything has gone excellently for white on the board and on the clock. Now, however, white has to be very precise. My great advantage is that black is tied, so I can choose when and where to strike. This would be no advantage if I strike at the wrong moment and simply release black's pieces.

"My position is not yet so good that I didn't hope to take advantage of my opponent's time trouble.
