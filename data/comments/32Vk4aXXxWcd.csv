"In this Nimzo-Indian position Black has some compensation for White's Bishop pair in the form of a slight lead in development. Such a lead can always be best utilized by opening the position. It follows that it is usually very difficult to make use of a lead in development as compensation for Bishop pair, since they also carry most weight in an open position.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a weakness in Black's development strategy due to the Bishop pair.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
