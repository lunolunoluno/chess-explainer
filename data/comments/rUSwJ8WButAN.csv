"Moving an already-developed piece once again. One may be thinking it's attacking the bishop so it's all right, but in this position due to black's open king and his newly undefended bishop, Tim came up with a tactic that gains considerable advantage while eliminating black's right to castle. It must be said, however, that if Black continues correctly he could establish a strong knight at d5. However, in the opening, there usually isn't time for these kind of maneuvers. Tim suggested 1. 0�a5 or 10. g5 as creating counterplay for Black. He didn't provide the line for 10, g5 which leaves me speculative, but I agree with 10. a5 for sure. Though 10. g5 11. a3 Ba5 12.
