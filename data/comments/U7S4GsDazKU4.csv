"A theory draw you would think in an elite tournament? Well, not really! Cast your minds back to another Spanish elite tournament (Dos Hermanas, 1996), and you'll discover that Garry Kasparov managed to beat Judit Polgar in this ending - albeit with a little help from his opponent, who made the cardinal error of trapping her king on the backrank. The only reason I remember this was I had to do a review in a magazine of the ChessBase Endgame CD-Rom's containing all five-piece major endings on 4-CDs, which had just come out at the time. I still find them indispensible - particularly as coasters when friends come round and I don't want stains on the coffee table! However, with Shirov's king so central, the only way he could lose it now was by a Helpmate. Shirov makes no mistake of that.",True," The comment provides context about a specific tournament and a player's memory, suggesting a mistake was made due to a tactical error.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.
