At 15 years old and a rating of 1179, this opening is not ideal. Until they reach a rating of 1500+, it's recommended that they explore different openings, such as the King's Indian Attack.

Nf3 e6 2. Nc3,This is a game between W35 (as White) and B35 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3," The move played by White to c3 was premature in this situation. White should have prioritized advancing the c-pawn to c4 to control the center. This would have allowed White to bring out additional pieces to exert more influence and create more targets for Black. Instead, White's move weakened their pawn structure and gave Black opportunities to disrupt White's position. It's essential to play strategically in the opening, and this move deviated from the common principles of Queen's Pawn games."
