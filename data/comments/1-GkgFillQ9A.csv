"'Black develops his pieces sensibly but with no specific aims in view' - Ray Keene commenting on Andersson - Radulov, Nice 1974. In that game Black played b6 and Bb7 but the salient feature is the same. White's control of e5. Black's best plan involves f6 and e5, as Alex Nisbet demonstrated to me in the SCCA Championship 1997-98.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the lack of specific aims in Black's play and suggests a better plan involving f6 and e5.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to f6"," 'While developing their pieces logically, Black lacks a clear strategy. White maintains dominance over e5. A more effective approach for Black should have been Nf6 followed by e5, as demonstrated by Alex Nisbet.'"
"The Black Rooks surely belong on c8 and d8, and his next move invites occupation of e5 with tempo.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies a critical mistake, suggesting that the Black Rooks are in the wrong squares, and predicts a tactical opportunity for the opponent.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to d8"," The move by Black places their rooks on the optimal squares c8 and d8. Their next move, however, doesn't seem to offer any tactical advantage in terms of gaining tempo or creating pressure."
"# The authentic Reti formation - see for example the classic Reti - Rubinstein, Karlsbad 1923. But my favourite example, indeed my all time favourite game is Larsen - Geller, Copenhagen 1960, culminating in the wonderful move Qa1-h8!",False,"

The comment is not addressing the mistake made by the player; instead, it's comparing different chess strategies and favorites of various players.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to a1",-
"Presumably Black intended to play this Rook to a6, but see note at move 19.",True,"

The explanation provided clarifies that Black had an intention to move their Rook to a6, but this move was not possible due to a previous move by White at move 19, thereby explaining the mistake.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1 Rc8 14. Nce5 Nb4 15. Rcc1 Rd6,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to d6"," It appears Black may have chosen to move their Rook to d6 rather than to a6, which could be an unnecessary or less effective choice."
"# 'This position would gladen the heart of Reti himself. For his subtle opening has, ultimately, the same object as all the others - the domination of the centre'. Peter Clarke on Tal - Botvinnik, 1960 match game 11. Yes, tal was White!",False,"

The comment refers to a strategic understanding of chess and the subtle nuances of gameplay, but it does not specifically address the mistake made in the game.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1 Rc8 14. Nce5 Nb4 15. Rcc1 Rd6 16. e4 Bg4 17. d4,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4",-
"This is equivelent to resignation, but 20...Nxa2 21.Rc4 would be even worse.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player, indicating that 20...Nxa2 is a poor move that could have been improved by playing 21.Rc4.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1 Rc8 14. Nce5 Nb4 15. Rcc1 Rd6 16. e4 Bg4 17. d4 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Qb8 19. dxc5 Rdd8 20. Bd4 Nc6,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"," After Black's last move, White has a challenging situation. Playing 20...Nxa2 results in a loss of a pawn, and the subsequent 21.Rc4 would put Black in a very unfavorable position."
"Attacking c4, f3 and b1, but after",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake by highlighting the attack on the targeted squares, indicating that the move was unsuccessful.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1 Rc8 14. Nce5 Nb4 15. Rcc1 Rd6 16. e4 Bg4 17. d4 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Qb8 19. dxc5 Rdd8 20.

Bxd6 Qxd6 33. e5 Qd3,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Landeck, Gerhard (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to d3"," White plays an aggressive move, threatening c4, f3, and b1, but Black counters effectively."
Black resigned since 34...Rc8 35.Rc3 wins a piece and 35.Rd4 is even stronger.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it details the consequences of their move (34...Rc8) and offers insights on stronger alternatives.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Na3 c5 4. Nxc4 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Rc1 e6 8. g3 Be7 9. Bg2 Qc7 10. O-O O-O 11. d3 Rad8 12. Rc2 Rd7 13. Qa1 Rc8 14. Nce5 Nb4 15. Rcc1 Rd6 16. e4 Bg4 17. d4 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Qb8 19. dxc5 Rdd8 20.
