"(IGM David Bronstein): Which Grandmaster wouldn't make this move, possibly even without thinking too long about it, irrespective of the consequences? I bet, nine out of ten! It is just too good an opportunity to miss. (Ligterink): Up to here the spectators were hardly interested in this somewhat dull game, but from this moment onwards all attention was for this game.

(Ree): When Kasparov played this move (and in fact already a few moves earlier) he had calculated that he had a draw for sure and had vaguely felt that more was possible. Then, while Topalov was thinking about his reply, Kasparov said that he saw the position until move 39.Qxh8.

(Pam): It would be unfair to Topalov to give this move a question mark, because there are few grandmasters who would not make this move. Kasparov was afraid that Topalov would refuse the sacrifice with 24...Kb6. He saw that after 25.b4 there would be no immediate advantage for White. After the game Topalov said that he had seen everything up to move 33 and could not resist the temptation to take a full Rook and let Kasparov justify his sacrifice. (Jongsma): Kasparov indicated that Black should have refused this sacrifice with 24...Kb6 and after 25.b4 White would not longer have an advantage. Thank goodness it didn't come to that.
