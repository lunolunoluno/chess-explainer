"Lilienthal opens in classical fashion, and Capablanca shows his flexibility by adopting the NimzoIndian Defense -- a fashionable new continuation at the time that shocked some of the classically-minded theoreticians. The NimzoIndian is a formidably complex opening with many fascinating byways, but the ideas at the outset are not too difficult to understand. White, by playing 3.Nc3, threatens to play 4.e4. Even the ""hypermodernists"" realized that giving White this much leeway in the center was a recipe for trouble, so Black must find a way to deter White from occupying that square. The standard method, before Nimzowitsch began to spread his heresy, was 3...d5, transposing into a Queen's Gambit Declined. This effectively stops 4.e4 by putting additional guards on that key square. The Nimzoindian, by contrast, stops e4 by depriving the pawn of support -- the pinned N/c3 is no longer rendering active service. White has a wide range of responses. 4.Qc2, one of the earliest moves to gain favor, has recently come back into vogue. During the 1970's, it was difficult to find any master who would play anything but 4.e3. Romanishin experimented with 4.g3 in the 1980's. But Lilienthal was fond of a blunt approach championed by Saemisch.",True," The comment offers insightful analysis of a specific opening variation, suggesting the mistake stemmed from a lack of understanding of the strategic implications rather than a fundamental flaw in the move itself.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Putting the question to the Bishop. Since Black frequently exchanges on c3 of his own free will, this can seem like a loss of time. But matters are not so simple. For the tempo spent forcing Black to make his choice, White gets a clarified central position in which he knows, to some extent, what Black's options are. The theoretical battle is still going on, though it's not quite so hot as it once was. Saemisch's 4.a3 remains a viable approach to the position for those who know it well. Lilienthal knows it very well indeed.",True," The comment analyzes the move's strategic implications and highlights a potential tactical disadvantage, suggesting the mistake was a missed opportunity to exploit a more active position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"One of Black's positional goals in the Nimzoindian is to cripple White's c-pawns and then assault them, particularly the P/c4. Capablanca abandons the struggle over e4 here in order to take a simplifying line in which his Bishop will be exchanged for White's B/f1.

"What is the point of this stunning Queen sacrifice? How can White get away with it?

Re1! and Capablanca's major pieces are lined up for an unavoidable fork with Ne7. As a career highlight, a crushing defeat of Capablanca with a brilliant Queen sacrifice would do any player proud. Lilienthal continued to play the Saemisch variation against the Nimzoindian and produced many wonderful games, but this one is difficult to top.
