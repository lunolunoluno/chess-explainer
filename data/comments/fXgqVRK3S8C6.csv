"Lilienthal opens in classical fashion, and Capablanca shows his flexibility by adopting the NimzoIndian Defense -- a fashionable new continuation at the time that shocked some of the classically-minded theoreticians. The NimzoIndian is a formidably complex opening with many fascinating byways, but the ideas at the outset are not too difficult to understand. White, by playing 3.Nc3, threatens to play 4.e4. Even the ""hypermodernists"" realized that giving White this much leeway in the center was a recipe for trouble, so Black must find a way to deter White from occupying that square. The standard method, before Nimzowitsch began to spread his heresy, was 3...d5, transposing into a Queen's Gambit Declined. This effectively stops 4.e4 by putting additional guards on that key square. The Nimzoindian, by contrast, stops e4 by depriving the pawn of support -- the pinned N/c3 is no longer rendering active service. White has a wide range of responses. 4.Qc2, one of the earliest moves to gain favor, has recently come back into vogue. During the 1970's, it was difficult to find any master who would play anything but 4.e3. Romanishin experimented with 4.g3 in the 1980's. But Lilienthal was fond of a blunt approach championed by Saemisch.",False,"

The comment doesn't address a specific move made by the player but provides an explanation of the NimzoIndian Defense, suggesting the player's choice was a calculated one rather than a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Putting the question to the Bishop. Since Black frequently exchanges on c3 of his own free will, this can seem like a loss of time. But matters are not so simple. For the tempo spent forcing Black to make his choice, White gets a clarified central position in which he knows, to some extent, what Black's options are. The theoretical battle is still going on, though it's not quite so hot as it once was. Saemisch's 4.a3 remains a viable approach to the position for those who know it well. Lilienthal knows it very well indeed.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the strategic implications of the move, noting that it leads to a clearer understanding of Black's options, though it may seem like a loss of time.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3,"This is a game between  Lilienthal, A.  (as White) and  Capablanca, J.  (as Black).

However, the situation isn't so straightforward. By initiating this exchange, White gains a clearer understanding of Black's possibilities.

"One of Black's positional goals in the Nimzoindian is to cripple White's c-pawns and then assault them, particularly the P/c4. Capablanca abandons the struggle over e4 here in order to take a simplifying line in which his Bishop will be exchanged for White's B/f1. The little flurry of tactics that now arises is easily foreseen by master players, but it's worth noting since it is a recurring theme in many d-pawn openings.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the strategic aim of Black's Nimzo-Indian Defense and the tactical potential that arises, which could explain why the move was considered a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

This does not really win a pawn: the idea is to simplify rather than to grab material.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as gaining a pawn without simplifying the position often leads to unnecessary complications and doesn't necessarily contribute to a strategic advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Here is Black's idea. White has a large center, but provided Black can maintain control over key breakthrough points, the center will not be too important -- the more so because Black has managed to exchange off half of the minor pieces.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the consequences of Black's strategy and White's positional advantage, emphasizing the importance of maintaining control over breakthrough points despite the material advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

White holds a dominant center, but if Black can hold sway over critical areas of the board, the center's importance diminishes further since Black has already exchanged half their minor pieces."
"This position is what Capablanca was aiming for with 8...Ba6. Black's position is solid and presents no obvious weaknesses, his spatial deficit notwithstanding. It must have seemed a reasonable approach, offering a still-powerful ex-world-champion ample scope for outplaying his young opponent.",True,"

The comment acknowledges that the move was not a mistake since it was inspired by Capablanca's strategy, which can be considered sound given the solid position of the black pieces.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Lilienthal continues his development behind the powerful center, not rushing to attack until he is sure that his pieces will coordinate well.",True,"

The comment accurately describes Lilienthal's strategic approach to playing behind the powerful center, and it implies that the mistake might have been made by rushing to attack without ensuring sufficient coordination of his pieces.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 b6 6. f3 d5 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 Ba6 9. e4 Bxc4 10. Bxc4 dxc4 11. Qa4+ Qd7 12. Qxc4 Qc6 13. Qd3 Nbd7 14. Ne2,"This is a game between  Lilienthal, A.

"This prevents the a-pawn from being a target on a7, where it might be vulnerable to a later Qa6, for example. Yet the move loses time: Capablanca may have underestimated the force of Lilienthal's coming central play.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by explaining the strategic trade-off between protecting the a-pawn and losing time, which could have been exploited by the opponent's central play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

The comment explains the mistake because it points out the issues with the Queen's position, including the uncastled King and lack of pressure on e4, which could lead to a potential disadvantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"Capablanca continues to make long-range plans, underestimating the force of White's coming central pawn storm. The idea here is ...c5, threatening ...cxd4 since the R/c8 will pick up White's Queen after a sham sacrifice of Black's own Queen on d4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the underestimated threat of the central pawn storm and the potential recapture after a pawn sacrifice.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Moreover, Black's sacrifice of their own queen on d4 is premature, given the position."
"Naturally, Black cannot allow this pawn to capture on e6 or the opening of the center, combined with Black's failure to castle, will spell ruin.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the strategic mistake in allowing the pawn to advance, which weakens Black's position and results in a vulnerability in the center, coupled with Black's neglect to castle, leading to potential disadvantages in king safety.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

This move could be disastrous for Black if they're unable to castle, leaving their king unprotected and their pieces uncoordinated."
But Capablanca apparently counted on this move as an adequate reply. Black's idea is that the d-pawn is horizontally pinned against the weakness at e4.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as Capablanca's anticipated move would indeed leave the d-pawn horizontally pinned against the weakness at e4, showing a lack of understanding of the tactical situation.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"If Lilienthal were obligated to exchange Queens at this point, Capablanca would stand very well indeed. The White P/e5, recklessly advanced, would be a serious weakness that White could hardly hope to hold. But at this point Lilienthal is truly inspired and comes up with a conception that must have shaken Capablanca's normally imperturbably self-confidence to its very foundations.",True,"

The comment provides a detailed explanation of the mistake, highlighting the weakness introduced by the White's pawn advance to e5 and suggesting a stronger alternative play.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on e4"," Lilienthal's Queen move to e4 is a poor decision. It weakens their position significantly as White, with Black's Queen occupying a threatening square. This could lead to serious tactical issues for Lilienthal."
"What is the point of this stunning Queen sacrifice? How can White get away with it? The answer lies, as it usually does for any really difficult combination, in multiple factors: the opening of the e-file, the presence of the B/h4, and the arrival of a pawn at g7 which will simultaneously strike at h8 and take away a flight square at f8. Black has little choice now but to accept the Queen sacrifice. Trying to take the B/h4 instead fails, because of the most common of all tactical motifs, an undefended piece -- in this case, the R/c8. Thus: if 20...Qxh4 21.fxg7 Rg8 22.f6! and now 22...Nxf6 fails to 23.Qf5! forking f6 and c8 while pinning the hapless N/f6 against the f7 pawn.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of why the Queen sacrifice was a mistake by outlining the tactical consequences and potential threats that arise after the sacrifice.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 b6 6. f3 d5 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 Ba6 9. e4 Bxc4 10. Bxc4 dxc4 11. Qa4+ Qd7 12. Qxc4 Qc6 13. Qd3 Nbd7 14. Ne2 Rd8 15. O-O a5 16.

Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on f6"," White's Queen sacrifice is risky because it opens the e-file, exposes the bishop on h4, and advances a pawn to g7, all of which aim to attack h8. Black must accept the Queen sacrifice as trying to capture the bishop on h4 results in a rook on c8 being undefended. The following sequence of moves illustrates the danger: 

20...Qxh4 
21.fxg7 Rg8 
22.f6!

In this position, Black's move 22...Nxf6 is incorrect because 23.Qf5 forks the knight on f6 and the pawn on c8, while also pinned against the f7 pawn, thus Black cannot safely accept the Queen sacrifice."
Now the shape of Lilienthal's magnificent conception becomes visible: Black's King is trapped on the e-file. All that is necessary is a tempo-gaining move to get the N off of the file.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential of trapping the opponent's king and the need for a tempo-gaining move to free the knight.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

"And there it is! Now a R check will be deadly. Capablanca struggles on as best he can, but without much hope since he will finish this sequence by losing a N on e4. 22.Rfe1 also works but not as well, since Qxf5 simplifies somewhat.",True,"
