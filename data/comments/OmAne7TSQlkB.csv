E06: Closed Catalan: Early deviations,True,"

The comment accurately explains that the player deviated early from the Closed Catalan opening, which may have led to the mistake.",1. d4,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
This move releases the center tension. It is especially odd given that white moved his Knight to e5 to protect the c4 square. More vigorous is 9. e4 to destroy black's center. 9. Bf4 is also very playable.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the weakness caused by the move and provides alternative stronger options for White.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5"
This is an odd and ineffective placement of the Queen. It bites on steel and blocks the progress of Queenside development.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic blunder made by the player by placing the Queen in a vulnerable position and obstructing the development of other pieces, particularly the Queenside.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to b3"
"White may have traded his strong Knight away because he feared the maneuver Nc6-a5-c4. A timely b3 would have driven this Knight away from the c4 square. Therefore, his fear was not justified.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by pointing out that a timely b3 would have prevented the Knight's maneuver and that the player's fear was not justified.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on c6"
Black slowly gains space on both sides of the board. This subtle process eventually leads to megalomaniac total domination of the entire board.,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake, as it describes Black's strategy of gaining space on both sides of the board, which can lead to a dominant position, although the term ""megalomaniac total domination"" is exaggerated.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 16. Bd2 f5 17. Qd1 b4,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b4"
"This move at first appears to be a blunder. However, Nimzovich sees farther.",True,"

The comment suggests that while the move may seem like a mistake at first glance, the player made a strategic decision based on the overall position, which aligns with Nimzovich's philosophy of considering long-term implications.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 16. Bd2 f5 17. Qd1 b4 18. Nb1 Bb5 19. Rg1 Bd6,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d6"
"A good try. White hopes to gain time by attacking the Knight on h5. If black comes to its defense with Qf7, then e5 stuffs black and frees white's game.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by White, as it suggests an aggressive line that could potentially create threats and gain tempo, albeit the move does not necessarily solve the immediate issues present in the position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 16. Bd2 f5 17. Qd1 b4 18. Nb1 Bb5 19. Rg1 Bd6 20. e4,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
"A piece for two pawns, and central domination, and aggressively poised pieces, and open file, and...",True,"

The comment refers to a common misconception that trading a piece for at least two pawns is always advantageous, but in reality, the specific position and piece placement are crucial in determining the quality of the trade.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 16. Bd2 f5 17. Qd1 b4 18. Nb1 Bb5 19. Rg1 Bd6 20. e4 fxe4,"This is a game between Saemisch, Friedrich GM (as White) and Nimzovich, Aron GM (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e4"
"Here white resigned. Nearly all moves lead to a serious loss of material. After a pawn move or two, white will face complete Zugzwang. Zugzwang is a German word meaning 'a compulsion to move.' White is forced to move, and in so doing will lose. If white plays 26. Rc1 or Rd1 then 26... Re2 wins white's Queen. If 26. Kh2 then 26... R5f3 also wins white's Queen. If 26. g4 then 26... R5f3 27. Bxf3 Rh2 is checkmate. If 26. Bc1 then 26... Bxb1 wins material. If 26. a3 then 26... a5. etc.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by detailing the potential losses in material and the resulting checkmate situations that could follow after the pawn move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 16. Bd2 f5 17. Qd1 b4 18. Nb1 Bb5 19.
