Black slowly gains space on both sides of the board.

"Here white resigned. Nearly all moves lead to a serious loss of material. After a pawn move or two, white will face complete Zugzwang. Zugzwang is a German word meaning 'a compulsion to move.' White is forced to move, and in so doing will lose. If white plays 26. Rc1 or Rd1 then 26... Re2 wins white's Queen. If 26. Kh2 then 26... R5f3 also wins white's Queen. If 26. g4 then 26... R5f3 27. Bxf3 Rh2 is checkmate. If 26. Bc1 then 26... Bxb1 wins material.
