This move makes sense but the Bishop does not belong here in this set up. The Bishop will go to d6 and the Queen Knight will plant itself on d7. The Queen Rook will go to c8 and then Black will hammer the White center with c5. The traditional idea is to get the Rook to c2 and then stack the heavy pieces on the c - file. This tends to be a very effective strategy for Black. In essence Black wastes a move. This is a common problem for computers. The machine generally calculates without a long term plan.,True," The comment identifies a flaw in the move, suggests a strategic error, and explains a common problem faced by chess engines, indicating a clear mistake.",1. d4 d5 2.

"Black is beginning to put the pieces where they belong. White must now generate some offense. Typically White will want to do one of two things. White will want to launch a ""minority"" Queen side attack using the two pawns supported by pieces against the three Black pawns. The other idea is to simply play in the middle. If we do a ""point count"" on the central squares we get this: For White, on d5 = 1 point, on e5 = 2 points, on d4 = 3 points, on e4 = zero points. Total = 6 points for White on central control. For Black, d5 is attacked/controlled 3 times, e5 gains 2 points, d4 is good for zip, while e4 nets two more points. Total for Black would be 7 points. Thus Black has a slight edge in the center.",True," The comment provides a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting Black has a slight advantage in the center due to point count.",1. d4 d5 2.

"This is known as a ""lever."" The threatened exchange forms an advantage at that spot for the one who created it. Meanwhile the one who liquidates it generally is at the disadvantage. Thus, Black will want to create as much pressure on d4 and the c - file before liquidating the lever. This is one of the ""subtleties"" of pawn play. Another way to do this with advantage would be to play 14...Rc8 first.

"Interesting contradiction in chess ideas. Technically White has managed to exchange off the ""bad"" Bishop, almost unforced. Yet if it had been allowed to exist on c3 then Black might have been faced with a very dangerous threat down the a1 - h8 diagonal. Black's choice is a practical one but it has an ugly down side.

"White completely misses the opportunity. Not only is this not good, it's close to a blunder. One of the problems with the move, other than missing a golden winning idea, is that it gives a center pawn away for a less valuable f - pawn.

"The computer finally reaches it threshold of pain and does the only sensible thing. Nice job. Prescription for improvement: First, your Endgame play is weak. As you get stronger (and your opponents get stronger) this will become a critical component of your game. Also it is a way to clip stronger players, if you can get to a superior Endgame. Most players focus on the Opening and Middlegame but if you get to the Endgame, you'll acquire a nice collection of scalps. Second, either switch to playing 1. e4 (good idea if you are under 1500) or burn the midnight oil on the positional aspect of the game. This game was positional, and you did well for the most part. If you can major on this and become the most boring chessnut in your neck of the woods, people will fear playing you. Once you get the positional ideas down, then you can work on the tactical. Generally the tactical aspect of the game is easier because it involves learning patterns and does not take much planning. It is one thing to capitalize on an opponent's mistake, it is another (much more satisfying event) to create the mistake that leads to the wonder combination. If this doesn't appeal to you watch a cat the next time it hunts. The cat doesn't mind the time it takes to stalk its prey. Nor does it have any scruples about playing with its helpless opponent before turning it into food. Just remember it's a game. When the cat's target gets away, it just stretches and looks for a shady spot for a nap. ""Go thou and do likewise."" Finally, take the batteries out of the computer and use it to hold something down. They are fun to play now and then but they will not help your game. In fact they will probably train you in some very bad habits. With the availability of the Internet there is someone available somewhere at all times to play.",True," The comment offers specific suggestions for improvement, suggesting a focus on endgame strategy and positional understanding, which directly addresses the player’s mistake.",1. d4 d5 2.

This move makes sense but the Bishop does not belong here in this set up. The Bishop will go to d6 and the Queen Knight will plant itself on d7. The Queen Rook will go to c8 and then Black will hammer the White center with c5. The traditional idea is to get the Rook to c2 and then stack the heavy pieces on the c - file. This tends to be a very effective strategy for Black. In essence Black wastes a move. This is a common problem for computers. The machine generally calculates without a long term plan.,True," The comment suggests the player's move is illogical and doesn't follow a clear plan, indicating a potential misunderstanding of the position.",1. d4 d5 2.
