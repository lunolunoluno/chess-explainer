"Later in life, Najdorf took up the King's Indian with formidable effect. His games at Zurich in 1953, along with those of Gligoric, made a profound impression on Bobby Fischer. But this game was played in the early 1930's, before Najdorf had discovered the King's Indian.

"This is Black's second decision point. With ...b6 and ...Bb7, he can set up a sort of Queen's Indian formation in which he has a good grip on e4.

"This very natural move may be a microscopic inaccuracy, since White can now trade pawns on d5 in a way that is strategically favorable.

Since White wishes to operate on the Queenside anyway, the open c-file is to his advantage.) 10.Bxf5 If Black captured with the e-pawn, he would be on his way toward freeing his B/c8 -- but alas, the f-pawn is momentarily undefended, so this is tactically untenable.",True," The comment offers a specific tactical explanation for the mistake, highlighting a potential disadvantage for Black.",1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3.
