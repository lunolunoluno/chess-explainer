Bc4,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to c4", The move was surprisingly ineffective in the context of a high-level game.
This treatment has become quite popular.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it appears to be unrelated to the chess move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8.

"Now it is safe to castle. Note that 10...d5?! is premature because of 11.Bb5+, as after 11...Bd7 12.Bxd7+ Qxd7 13.e5 Nc6 14.b4! Black cannot hang on to the advanced d-pawn for long.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by detailing the tactical sequence that threatens the advanced d-pawn on d5.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8.

Moving 10...d5 is an early mistake as 11.Bb5+ exploits this. After Black's attempts to shore up the pawn with 11...Bd7, White continues with 12.Bxd7+ Qxd7 13.e5 Nc6 14.b4. At this point, Black's pawn on d5 cannot be supported effectively, and White's position becomes stronger."
So that d6-d5 does not arrive with tempo and can thus be met by e4-e5.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by highlighting the lack of tempo in the move d6-d5, which could be easily countered by the opponent's e4-e5, allowing them to gain an advantage.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b3", White's move to Bishop to b3 does not create a d6-d5 break that can be effectively countered by e4-e5.
Aiming to knock out the bishop from a5. In his notes Short suggests 11...f5!? with similar play to Game 22.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the aggressive attempt to eliminate the opponent's bishop from a5, referencing a similar strategy from Game 22.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3 Nc6,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black).

"12...Bd7 13.Kh1 also slightly favors White, while after; 12...a5 13.a4 Qb6 14.Qh4 White can prepare the usual assault.",True,"

The comment highlights the potential weaknesses in the player's move sequence, making it an explanation of the mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3 Nc6 12. Bd2 d5,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"," White's move 13.Kh1 is not favorable as it weakens the king's position. Instead, Black's 12...a5 followed by White's 13.a4 sets up a stronger pawn structure for Black. After Black plays 12...Qb6, White's attempt to launch an attack with 14.Qh4 is less effective since Black has secured a solid pawn chain and can counteract the threat."
Vacating g1 so that the knight can head for e5.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as the move in question doesn't involve the knight moving to g1.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6.

An annoying little move which demands an accurate response.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as it highlights the poor quality of the move and indicates that an accurate response is required to counteract it.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3 Nc6 12. Bd2 d5 13. e5 f6 14. exf6 Bxf6 15. Kh1 a5,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black).

"Precise. On 16.a3 a4 17.Ba2 Qb6! 18.Rb1 Qc5 19.Rc1 Qb6, so you see the problem.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the problem with the move a4, as it weakens the pawn structure and exposes the king to threats.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3 Nc6 12. Bd2 d5 13. e5 f6 14. exf6 Bxf6 15. Kh1 a5 16. a4,"This is a game between Short, N (as White) and Gelfand, B (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a4", White's 16.a3 was a mistake. Black responded with 16...a4 17.Ba2 Qb6! 18.Rb1 Qc5 19.Rc1 Qb6. The issue with White's move was it allowed Black to gain space and strengthen their position quickly.
The latent dangers for Black are revealed in a line like 16...Qb6 (a bit further away from the king) 17.f5! when either 17...gxf5 18.Nf4 or 17...exf5 18.Qg3 exposes him to a powerful White initiative. Boris sensibly stays more central.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by pointing out the potential threats posed by Black's alternative moves and the strategic reasoning behind the chosen move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bc4 Bg7 6. O-O e6 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qe1 Nd4 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 O-O 11. Bb3 Nc6 12. Bd2 d5 13. e5 f6 14. exf6 Bxf6 15.

If they play 17...gxf5, White has 18.Nf4, which is strong. Alternatively, if Black captures the pawn with 17...exf5, White responds with 18.Qg3, which also poses a strong threat. Black wisely chooses a more central move."
"Gelfand banks on a queenside counter demonstration, as per usual in the Sicilian, but he would probably have done better to try to challenge in the center with 18...Rae8. After the game move Short maneuvers adroitly to defend the queen's flank whilst building up for an attacking breakthrough.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Gelfand, as it suggests an alternative move that would have been more beneficial to challenge in the center.",1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 Nc6 4.

Quite wrong. Black underestimates the threats and takes away an important defender. 22...Rae8 was called for.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the underestimation of threats and the loss of a vital defender with the move 22...Rae8.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Gelfand's idea is perhaps revealed in the line 23.Ne5? Bxe5 24.Rxe5 Nxc2! 25.Rc1 Qd6 , threatening to take on e5.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the potential winning line after the questionable move Ne5, which is actually a mistake as it allows Bxe5, leading to a strong attack on the e5 pawn.",1. e4 c5 2.

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by illustrating the positional disadvantages after the move bxa4 and showing the decisive attack that could follow.",1. e4 c5 2.

After 26...Kh8, White's 27.Ne5 is too aggressive, and after 26...Kxh7, the White's 27.Ng5+ is not as strong, as Black can play 27...Bxg5, followed by 28.Qxg5."
"On 25...Bxe5 26.Rxe5 Rae8 White knocks the props out of Black's game with 27.Bxb4 , but the best defense was 25...Ra7! when White would retain a big plus with 26.Nxd7 Rxd7 27.Rxf5.",True,"
