1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6,"Your move is a tad unusual but it works.
Typically the King's Bishop often finds its way to c4. Traditionally the idea

thing you must be aware of in the Opening is to grab any and all chances to
wreck your opponents pawn structure. Look at 5. Bxe6 fxe6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4

serious problems organizing anything useful with the shattered pawn structure.

moves are setting up a nice attack but do you understand what you are trying?
Often we hear the mantra to develop, so we develop and miss the point behind
why we are making the move. The idea of the opening is to create an
""imbalance"" [any difference in the position] - especially in minor piece
position - and develop around it. One idea of developing the Bishop to f4 is
to play h3 to give the Bishop a safe haven while keeping the Knight at bay.
BTW the pawns at e4 and c4 are considered a strong strategy against the
Sicilian.",True

happened. White is saddled with two ""backward"" pawns - on d3 and on b3. I'd
call this a positional nightmare, but against a weak opponent you will have an
interesting fight on your hands. The squares in front of them are called
""holes"" where Black will plant a piece. This is called a ""blockade."" The
strength of a blockade is that the pawn is immobile. In chess, if it doesn't
[or can't] move it will suffer violence. Keep your position as flexible as
possible while coaxing your opponent into making his as ridged as possible.
Another strength of the blockade is that it is a base of operation against the
opponent. The blockader can not be attacked through the weak pawn.",True

Bishop is misguided and at this point fatal. Don't attack something for the
sake of attacking. Always ask yourself, ""what is my opponent threatening?"" ""If
I move this what can my opponent threaten or take?"" You must have a solid
positional reason to attack. Generally if it is mobile, look somewhere else
unless you are attempting to create a weakness such as immobility or a poorly
defended piece. As much as possible ""over protect"" everything [pieces and
important squares]. By creating an interlocking web of pieces you will make
them ""all"" mobile [perfect for attack or defense]. Think ""internet."" Anything

move your Q to b1 instead of moving the pawns. I suspect when you start moving

attack style. Be a threat to everyone you meet. Put some effort into learning
pawn play. ""Pawns are the soul of chess."" Most plans revolve around the pawn
structure. If you get this down you will become difficult for the ""sharks""

to do anything you will regret. Don't panic - if you find yourself tempted to
move pawns sit on your hands and breath [that's when you inhale and exhale air
from your lungs - I often forget in a tense game] then look for a logical line
that the position demands. Keep examining your lost games, your courage will
take you far! [I read that on a ""Chinese fortune"" cookie once - grin.] Develop
