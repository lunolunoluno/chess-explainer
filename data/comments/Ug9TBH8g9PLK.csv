Your move is a tad unusual but it works. Typically the King's Bishop often finds its way to c4. Traditionally the idea is to play 3. d4 cxd4 4.

Your opponent errs. The one thing you must be aware of in the Opening is to grab any and all chances to wreck your opponents pawn structure. Look at 5. Bxe6 fxe6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nf6 9. f4. This may be my personality but I feel Black has serious problems organizing anything useful with the shattered pawn structure. The only redeeming quality is that Black as three center pawns.,True," The comment offers specific criticisms of Black's pawn structure, suggesting a lack of development and tactical planning.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 4. O-O Be6,This is a game between W15 (as White) and B15 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6,Advantage for White (eval: 88 centipawns),5.

"Remember to play with a plan! The last few moves are setting up a nice attack but do you understand what you are trying? Often we hear the mantra to develop, so we develop and miss the point behind why we are making the move. The idea of the opening is to create an ""imbalance"" [any difference in the position] - especially in minor piece position - and develop around it. One idea of developing the Bishop to f4 is to play h3 to give the Bishop a safe haven while keeping the Knight at bay. BTW the pawns at e4 and c4 are considered a strong strategy against the Sicilian.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic misunderstanding of the opening and pawn structure.",1. e4 c5 2.

Here you have to look at playing 10. Qd2 with the idea of playing Bh6 to rid the game of the Dragon Bishop.

It looks like your move loses a pawn but it is a gutsy idea. The aggressiveness of your play will help you as you learn the various tactical possibilities of a position. One suggestion is to concentrate on pattern recognition. Learn the various patterns behind combinations.

The pawn on d6 moves to d7 and completely chokes Black's middle. The Black Rooks become totally useless and you own all the important squares.

"21. cxd3 was necessary. It is ugly but playable. It's better than what happened. White is saddled with two ""backward"" pawns - on d3 and on b3. I'd call this a positional nightmare, but against a weak opponent you will have an interesting fight on your hands. The squares in front of them are called ""holes"" where Black will plant a piece. This is called a ""blockade."" The strength of a blockade is that the pawn is immobile. In chess, if it doesn't [or can't] move it will suffer violence. Keep your position as flexible as possible while coaxing your opponent into making his as ridged as possible. Another strength of the blockade is that it is a base of operation against the opponent. The blockader can not be attacked through the weak pawn.",True," The comment offers insights into the positional weaknesses and strategic ideas behind the mistake, suggesting a potential need for a more flexible opening.",1. e4 c5 2.

"23. Qf3 or 23. Rc1. Your idea of chasing the Knight with the Bishop is misguided and at this point fatal. Don't attack something for the sake of attacking. Always ask yourself, ""what is my opponent threatening?"" ""If I move this what can my opponent threaten or take?"" You must have a solid positional reason to attack. Generally if it is mobile, look somewhere else unless you are attempting to create a weakness such as immobility or a poorly defended piece.
