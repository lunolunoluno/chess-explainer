"At the time this game was played gambits were still very popular, since most players felt uncomfortable when having to defend. As a rule the player who had won one or more pawns tried stubbornly to hold on to them, arguing that if he could parry the enemy attack without conceding any material his advantage woud give him a certain win in the ending. Before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame as Dr Tarrasch used to preach in those days. What he meant by that is drastically shown in the game:",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the playerâ€™s mistake, suggesting a defensive strategy that undermined the position.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

"Black voluntarily returns one of the pawns, and in doing so is determinded to catch up in development. Simple and obvious though this may seem to us today, it must be remembered that this game was played in another era. The principle - brand new at the time - which Black applies here is in general a good remedy for all gambits. It is just this willingness to return the material won whenever seems proper which has damped the enthusiasm of today's players. This princple of Maroczy's is of greatest import to the defender",True," The comment offers a rationale for the mistake, suggesting a strategic principle that might be outdated and detrimental to modern chess.",1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4.

The counterattack is now in full swing.
