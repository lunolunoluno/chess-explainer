"An improvement over the classical line 8.Bd3 Nxc3 9.Bd2 (or 9.a3 Na2+ 10.Bd2 Bxd2+ 11.Kxd2 c5 12.Rxa2 Nc6 with advantage to Black) 9...Nxa2 10.c3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Be7 and Black was better in Yanovsky-Marshall, Ostende 1907.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by suggesting a better continuation for White after the move 8.Bd3 Nxc3, which leads to a more favorable position for Black according to historical games.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
"Accepting the gambit with 9...Nxc3 10.Bd3 Nc6 can be dangerous after 11.h4 Ne7 (11...Qe7 12.h5 g5 13.f4! was good for White in Klovan-Makarichev, USSR 1978.) 12.f3! with advantage Kurajica-Dvorecki, Wijk aan Zee I 1976.",True,"

The comment successfully explains the mistake by showcasing a specific sequence of moves where accepting the gambit with 9...Nxc3 leads to a strong advantage for White after 11.h4 Ne7, supported by historical game examples.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
White's pieces are well developed and ready to attack the weakened Black kingside.,True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player since it highlights that despite the pieces being well developed, they are not being utilized to attack the weakened Black kingside effectively.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black).

"Of course, Black cannot take the bishop immediately - 14...fxg6? 15.Qxg6+ Kf8 when either 16.Be3 or 16.f4 gives White a strong attack.",True,"

This comment explains the mistake by highlighting the potential lines after 14...fxg6, indicating a strong attack for White after 15.Qxg6+ Kf8.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to g8"
"White has already three pawns for the piece with a raging attack, but the success of White's intuitive sacrifice depends on whether Black has chances to evacuate his King to the Queenside and consolidate his forces. My opponent almost succeeded.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by highlighting the risky nature of the pawn sacrifice and the potential counterplay White's opponent has, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on h6"
"Intending to protect the kingside. 18...Re8 looks more sensible, but it fails to 19.Qf6+ Kc7 (if 19...Re7 20.Ng6 wins) 20.Nxd5+!",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move by explaining the potential threat and the better alternative move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e7"
Threatening to attack the d5-pawn with 20.c4. Such forcing threats are the best tactical resource in positions where the opponent has not finished his development. 19.Bxc5 Qxc5 20.Nxe6+ Bxe6 21.Qxe6 is weaker.,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake by illustrating a tactical sequence that capitalizes on the opponent's unfinished development, leading to a significant material disadvantage for the player who played the move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7 19.

Consistent. 20.Bxc5 Qxc5 21.Qxe6 Rf8 22.Qh6 Kc7 looks attractive but is unclear.,True,"

The comment explains a potential blunder made by the player after 20.Bxc5 Qxc5 21.Qxe6 Rf8 22.Qh6 Kc7, suggesting that the move looks attractive but its consequences are unclear, possibly indicating a missed opportunity or a tactical oversight.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7 19. Rfd1 Bd7 20. c4,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4"
Not 20...dxc4? 21.Bxc5 Qxc5 22.Nxe6+ and White wins.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake made by the player, as 20...dxc4 allows White to exploit the pin on the c-file after 21.Bxc5 Qxc5 22.Nxe6+, leading to a winning position for White.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7 19. Rfd1 Bd7 20. c4 Rc8,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c8"
A serious error. Correct was 21.cxd5 exd5 (or 21...Nxd5 22.Nxd5 exd5 23.Qf6+ Kc7 24.Qd6+ Kd8 25.e6 winning) 22.c4! with a decisive attack.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, suggesting a better alternative move (21.cxd5 exd5 or 21...Nxd5) rather than the played move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7 19. Rfd1 Bd7 20. c4 Rc8 21. Qh4,"This is a game between Shamkovich, L (as White) and Chistiakov (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h4"

Not 23.Nxe6+ Bxe6 24.dxe6 Nf3+ 25.Kh1 Nxh4 26.Bb6+ Ke8 27.Bxa5 Rxg2 and Black wins.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it outlines the sequence of moves leading to Black's winning position after the player's blunder.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.

"Intending to safeguard the King, and at the same time, to connect the rooks. Other tries are likely to favor White, e.g., 24...exd5 25.Nxd5 Nxd4 (if 25...Rxc2 26.e6! or 25...Rc4 26.Nf6) 26.Rxd4 Qc5 27.Rad1 with the initiative.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by highlighting the lack of coordination between the rooks and the potential for White to gain an advantage with moves like 24...exd5 or 25...Rxc2/Rc4, which could lead to a better position for White.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 Ne4 7. Qg4 g6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Ne2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Nc5 13. O-O Nc6 14. Bxg6 Rg8 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qh5+ Ke7 17. Qxh6 Kd8 18. Nf4 Ne7 19.

"Black has consolidated his forces and is now on top. He has the option of pursuing a number of promising continuations, e.g., 27...exd5 28.Nxd5 Nxd4 29.Rxd4 Ne6; 27...Nxd4; 27...Ba4 28.Rd2 Bb3; 27...Qa4 with sufficient counterplay in all lines.",False,"

"My opponent - a glorious chess veteran who always sought active play - had planned to transfer his queen to the kingside for a counterattack, but he underestimated the threats on the other side of the board. This was a super-bold idea although 27...Nxd4 28.Rxd4 Qxa3 seems a better way of capturing the a-pawn.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting an overlooked threat on the opposite side of the board which could have led to a better outcome for the opponent.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Attacking the White knight, a key element in White's king fortress. However, Black could play more interestingly - utilizing the long-ranging queen at h7, e.g., 30...Ne4!? (Idea 31...Neg3+) 31.Ra3 Rg3! but 32.Re1! still wins for White, or 30...exd5 31.cxd5 Rc2!? 32.Qxc2! Ng3+ 33.fxg3 Qxc2 34.Bd4 a6 35.e6! and White is still on top. As we shall see, Black's counterattack is by no means naive in concept.",True,"
