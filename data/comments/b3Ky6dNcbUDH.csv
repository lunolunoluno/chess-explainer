"This could be just a move-order trick, or a signal that white is going to play one of the systems without c2-c4, for example the Torre (3.Bg5) or the Zukertort (3.e3, 4. Bd3, 5. b3,...). As a generality, if white is just going to play c4 later, I think this move loses more flexibility than it gains. However, once you know your own and your opponent's repertoire this may not be the case. For example black cannot get a Benko proper now if white doesn't want to co-operate. This may have been what black had in mind, because he isn't happy to let white transpose to one of various standard openings, so the game goes down a relatively original path.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses possible strategies and the motivations of the opponent rather than directly addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3,"This is a game between Hebden, Mark (as White) and Degraeve, Jean-Marc (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3",-
"Bravo! This is the ""I'm not going to let you get back into a normal opening"" move.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it refers to the move as an attempt to disrupt the opponent's normal opening strategy, suggesting it was an intentional but unsuccessful maneuver.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5,"This is a game between Hebden, Mark (as White) and Degraeve, Jean-Marc (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b5"," 'Good effort, but White isn't following the expected strategic path. It's too early for Black to challenge the center aggressively with Pawn to b5.'"
"A thematic looking idea which doesn't work, but Hebden's continuation was not so easy to foresee. It takes a lot of courage to explore these variations that are off the beaten track, and for that Degraeve gets my respect. I remember annotating some of my own games a couple years ago that reached distinctly messy positions, and it was incredible to me how many mistakes and outright blunders were made in such games. Even 450 points up the rating ladder, I suspect that it isn't easy.",True,"

The comment acknowledges a mistake in the move, explains that the continuation was not easy to foresee, and shows respect for the player's exploration of uncharted variations.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5 4. Bg5 Ne4 5. Bf4 Bb7 6. a4 Qa5+,"This is a game between Hebden, Mark (as White) and Degraeve, Jean-Marc (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to a5 with check"," White's move was thematic yet unsuccessful, and Black's response, Queen to a5, was unexpectedly aggressive. It's commendable for White to venture into uncharted territory, but this aggression by Black was a bold choice. Despite being ahead, White faces an uphill battle, as such positions can quickly turn complex and mistake-prone, even for higher-rated players. In my own games, I've seen such positions lead to significant errors, reflecting the difficulty in managing them effectively."
"This is the sting. Without this move, black is behind in development, but had good prospects with a grip on the center, and a better pawn structure. Now he is losing the fight in the center, coming under pressure on the queenside, falls further begind in development (e4 hitting the bishop), and is fighting to stay alive.",True,"

The annotation accurately identifies a significant mistake by the player, highlighting the consequences of the move on the overall game position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5 4. Bg5 Ne4 5.

Last move played: White plays Rook to a4"," White's move to a4 was a critical error that negatively affected Black's position. This move allowed White to gain control of the center, which was previously a stronghold for Black. As a result, Black's piece coordination suffered, leading to a disadvantage in development, particularly with White's pawn on e4 threatening Black's bishop. This strategic misstep has put Black's position under significant strain, both centrally and on the queenside."
"There is no way to defend a7, so white has a big advantage after only 12 moves. Impressive, but now black digs in.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights the strategic weakness created by the pawn move, indicating that white has a significant advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"A very nice shot, but 13. Be3 was also strong, when there remains nothing for black to do to avoid 14. Rxa7.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it actually praises the move and suggests that the player's move was strong despite the potential threat.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5 4.

"Both sides splay some originality this game. In this case it all comes to a disappointment for black, but 14...Kxe7, increasing co-ordination along the back rank, is nonetheless a nice motif to remember. 14...Qxe7 15.Rxa7 was simply losing, but now he is ready to meet 15.Rxa7 with 15...Nd7 and 16...Nb6. Of course white is still much better here and black doesn't have any active compensation for the pawn, but the extra pawn is on the queenside where black has a sturdy blockade, and he just might be able to hold.",True,"

The comment provides a clear evaluation of the move, explaining why it is considered a mistake and offering insight into the strategic implications of the position following the blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5 4. Bg5 Ne4 5. Bf4 Bb7 6. a4 Qa5+ 7. Nbd2 Bxd5 8. axb5 Qd8 9. Ra4 Nxd2 10. Nxd2 d6 11. e4 Bb7 12. Qa1 e5 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bxe7 Kxe7,"This is a game between Hebden, Mark (as White) and Degraeve, Jean-Marc (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King takes on e7"," Both sides demonstrated originality in this game. However, for Black, the move 14...Kxe7, while improving coordination on the back rank, was a disappointing choice. It led to a disadvantageous position after 15.Rxa7, as White would have a clear path to victory. Fortunately, Black is prepared to counter with 15...Nd7 and 16...Nb6, but White maintains a significant lead. The extra pawn Black holds on the queenside is a potential asset, but White's overall position is much stronger."
"An interesting moment, which brings up the point that it doesn't always pay to be super-sophisticated. Instead of taking the pawn, white prefers to triple pieces on the a-file and simply maintain the pressure. In some ways leaving black's pawn on the board doesn't make his position any easier to play, but I wonder nonetheless, did Hebden just assume he could triple pieces and pick up the a7-pawn at his leisure? It turns out this isn't the case.",True,"

The comment accurately explains that White chose a less risky move by strengthening their position instead of capturing Black's pawn, revealing a potential overestimation of the benefits.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

O-O,"This is a game between Hebden, Mark (as White) and Degraeve, Jean-Marc (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"," Hebden made a questionable decision by opting for a more aggressive setup on the a-file, potentially overlooking the risks. By pushing their pieces forward rather than capturing the pawn immediately, Hebden might have underestimated the implications of leaving Black's pawn intact on the board. This could have left Black's position less fortified and easier to navigate, even though it might not have been immediately obvious. The move seems to overlook a straightforward approach that could have simplified the position for Black."
"It isn't possible for white to just win the pawn, for tactical reasons. Therefore he uses his pressure to regroup.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the tactical reasons behind the move, emphasizing the importance of using pressure to regroup rather than winning the pawn outright.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"The purpose of this move is not so easy to guess, even after you have seen it. What do you think?",False,"
