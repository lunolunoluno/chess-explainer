"This could be just a move-order trick, or a signal that white is going to play one of the systems without c2-c4, for example the Torre (3.Bg5) or the Zukertort (3.e3, 4. Bd3, 5. b3,...). As a generality, if white is just going to play c4 later, I think this move loses more flexibility than it gains. However, once you know your own and your opponent's repertoire this may not be the case. For example black cannot get a Benko proper now if white doesn't want to co-operate. This may have been what black had in mind, because he isn't happy to let white transpose to one of various standard openings, so the game goes down a relatively original path.",True," The comment offers a plausible explanation for the mistake, suggesting a potential tactical or strategic reason behind the move's perceived weakness.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"A thematic looking idea which doesn't work, but Hebden's continuation was not so easy to foresee. It takes a lot of courage to explore these variations that are off the beaten track, and for that Degraeve gets my respect.

"An interesting moment, which brings up the point that it doesn't always pay to be super-sophisticated. Instead of taking the pawn, white prefers to triple pieces on the a-file and simply maintain the pressure. In some ways leaving black's pawn on the board doesn't make his position any easier to play, but I wonder nonetheless, did Hebden just assume he could triple pieces and pick up the a7-pawn at his leisure?

"Having seen the conclusion of the game, I can state here with relative confidence that white is winning, due to the d-pawn and the weakness of black's king.
