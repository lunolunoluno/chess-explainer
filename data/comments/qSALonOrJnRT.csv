"A multi-purpose move. White clears g5 for occupation by a Knight, and at the same time prepares to plant the Bishop on g3, attacking the e-pawn. In itself this attack is nothing unusual, but the presence of the Bishop on g3 has an ulterior significance. The structure of the position will sooner or later require Black to play ... Pc6, and the ideal post for his King would typically be on c7, after which he could complete his development. However, it is clear that the existence of a White Bishop on g3 would defeat Black's idea. As a result the Black King will be relegated to staying in the centre, with all the dangers that implies",True," The comment offers a nuanced explanation of the mistake, highlighting the strategic implications of the Bishop's placement.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3.
