"In theory, White could still play Ng5 and trade his Knight and Bishop for Black's Rook and pawn.

"Marshall errs here. The d5-Knight wasn't hurting him in the least and he wasn't forced to capture it. He was better off letting White pick which piece he wanted to capture (the b4-Bishop or the f6-Knight). Had White followed up with a capture, he would have lost time (the Knight making three moves to capture a piece that's only moved once).",True,".

"In theory, White could still play Ng5 and trade his Knight and Bishop for Black's Rook and pawn. But the Bishop-Knight combination is a much more potent attacking force than a Rook and pawn, especially when there is a lot of material still on the board (due to the Knight's leaping ability).",True," The comment suggests a potential loss of the Queen, implying a strategic blunder.",1. e4 e5 2.
