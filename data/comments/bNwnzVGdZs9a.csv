"It's rather amazing to me that this opening variation should continue to be the primary defense of many top GMs. It was invented in the 1950s by Najdorf (originally of Poland, but after World War II of Argentina) and fought over throughout the 1960s and 70s. Bobby Fischer utilized it and honed it like a knife. Many years later, after other defenses have been tried and many discarded, this is Kasparov's favorite. It's interesting also to note that there are a zillion 6th moves White can choose from, and the one played most these days by the top GMs is 6. Be3, a move (and system) created by GM Robert Byrne, a New Yorker who was a childhood (and perhaps lifelong) friend of Bobby Fischer. Did he invent this opening variation to combat Fischer? I don't know. It was taken up by Englishmen and made more popular in the 1980s and 90s. Now it's commonplace.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the historical significance and popularity of the opening variation, suggesting that its continued use by top players implies a belief in its effectiveness, despite the existence of numerous alternatives.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"," This opening move isn't particularly strong. It's a common choice for White, but it doesn't offer a strong advantage. The move was popularized by GM Robert Byrne in the 1980s and 90s, but it doesn't seem to be as effective as other options."
"Fischer preferred 6. Bc4 and that's still considered good, but it's not to the taste of today's players. I suppose I should also add that 6. Bg5 was ""all the rage"" during the 1960s and 70s when Fischer played actively, but his ""Poison Pawn Variation"" (after 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2) is still considered good, and it's one reason 6. Bg5 isn't played much now.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the historical context and relevance of 6. Bg5, as well as the rarity of its current usage due to the popularity of Fischer's ""Poison Pawn Variation"".",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"," Fischer liked 6. Bc4, but it doesn't appeal to modern players. Also, 6. Bg5 was popular with Fischer in the '60s and '70s, but after the Poison Pawn Variation (6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2), it's less common now."
"Particularly against 6. Be2 this move (6...e5) was Fischer's response. It is named for Opocensky, but like many variations, Fischer played it a lot and made it popular. It makes sense that as White he'd play 6. Bc4 if he thought Black might play 6...e5, leaving the c4-f7 diagonal open.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by providing historical context and strategic reasoning behind the move, indicating that White could have anticipated Black's potential move and chosen a different strategy accordingly.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"," In this game where Kasparov plays as Black and Anand as White, playing Pawn to e5, Fischer's choice of 6. Be2 is less common. Fischer might choose 6. Bc4 as it opens the c4-f7 diagonal against Black's potential 6...e5 move."
"Now there are a couple of weaknesses in Black's pawn structure, so White will have a clear idea of where to play (d5, d6, b6) . However, Pe5 controls d4 and with ...Bc8-e6 Black controls d5 pretty well too. Only Bf8 will be noticably bad.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the weaknesses in Black's pawn structure and provides potential moves for White to exploit those weaknesses.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black).

However, Pe5 blocks d4, and Black's...Bc8-e6 controls d5 effectively. Only Bf8 becomes a notable weakness."
There's no immediate need for this. He wants to play g2-g4-g5 to gain better control of d5. Playing Qd1-d2 is mainly to prepare O-O-O and I guess he doesn't want to commit to that yet.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the strategic intentions behind the move and why it could be considered a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3"," They could have played g2-g4-g5 to gain control over d5, but it's not necessary right now. By moving Qd1-d2, they are preparing for O-O-O but are hesitant to make that commitment yet."
"White gains by having the open h-file, but Black retains sufficient control of the central squares. It's also less clear where White's king will be safe. After the king-side pawns advanced he wouldn't be expected to O-O, though he might play Ke1-f2. With Black's queen-side pawns far advanced it's highly unlikely he'll O-O-O. On the other hand, Black's king seems perfectly safe, but Rh8 is going to be out of play if Ke8 stays in the middle of that rank.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by White, as it highlights the potential disadvantages of advancing the king-side pawns, leaving the king unsafe, and the possibility of White being unable to castle.",1. e4 c5 2.

Ng3 Nxg3 14. hxg3,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Kasparov, Garri (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on g3"," White's advance with the h-file opened up potential weaknesses and didn't secure a safe position for their king. The move also left White with unclear king safety, as they typically wouldn't castle kingside given the pawn structure. Meanwhile, Black's king is well-protected, but the rook on h8 may become ineffective if King e8 doesn't move away from the center."
He has to keep Pb4 defended.,True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the need to defend the pawn on b4, which may have been left vulnerable.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

White works around the edges as well as he can (Black can't do any better yet) and Pb4 stands out as a major weakness.,True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the edge play by White and identifies Pb4 as a major weakness, suggesting that Black's position has been compromised.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 Nbd7 9. g4 b5 10. g5 b4 11. Ne2 Nh5 12. Qd2 a5 13. Ng3 Nxg3 14. hxg3 a4 15. Nc1 Qa5 16. Nd3 d5 17. exd5 Qxd5 18. Bg2 Qb5 19.

"This isn't bad. It puts the king behind some pawns and develops Ra1-d1, to create a threat to Nd7.",False,"

The comment doesn't explain the mistake, as it seems to justify the move by pointing out potential advantages, rather than critiquing the move for its faults.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

I don't see the benefit of allowing White to close up the pawns around his king.,True,"

The comment accurately points out a potential strategic mistake, as allowing White to close up the pawns could lead to a cramped position and difficulty for the player's pieces to maneuver.",1. e4 c5 2.

"It seems a little risky to allow Nd5 to be pinned this way. Of course, it threatens Nd5-c7+, but Black will prevent that.",True,"

The comment appropriately identifies the potential pitfall of the move, highlighting the risk of getting the knight pinned and the specific threat that Black might counter.",1. e4 c5 2.

"It might be a little odd for this to be Black's only tactic, but Rh8 is still well stuck behind Ph7 and Nd5 is proving to be strong enough and White's king's position is plenty safe.",False,"

The comment incorrectly suggests that Rh8 is the only tactic for Black and that Nd5 is strong, whereas the mistake was actually a lack of space and activity on the board.",1. e4 c5 2.

Black has to wait.,True,"

The comment ""Black has to wait"" suggests that the player made a move that allowed the opponent to gain time or initiative, making them the active player in the game.",1. e4 c5 2.
