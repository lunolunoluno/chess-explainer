"It's rather amazing to me that this opening variation should continue to be the primary defense of many top GMs. It was invented in the 1950s by Najdorf (originally of Poland, but after World War II of Argentina) and fought over throughout the 1960s and 70s. Bobby Fischer utilized it and honed it like a knife. Many years later, after other defenses have been tried and many discarded, this is Kasparov's favorite. It's interesting also to note that there are a zillion 6th moves White can choose from, and the one played most these days by the top GMs is 6. Be3, a move (and system) created by GM Robert Byrne, a New Yorker who was a childhood (and perhaps lifelong) friend of Bobby Fischer. Did he invent this opening variation to combat Fischer? I don't know. It was taken up by Englishmen and made more popular in the 1980s and 90s. Now it's commonplace.",True," The comment provides context for why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting it’s an outdated and overplayed opening, potentially hindering strategic development.",1. e4 c5 2.

"Fischer preferred 6. Bc4 and that's still considered good, but it's not to the taste of today's players. I suppose I should also add that 6. Bg5 was ""all the rage"" during the 1960s and 70s when Fischer played actively, but his ""Poison Pawn Variation"" (after 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2) is still considered good, and it's one reason 6.

"Particularly against 6. Be2 this move (6...e5) was Fischer's response. It is named for Opocensky, but like many variations, Fischer played it a lot and made it popular. It makes sense that as White he'd play 6.

"Now there are a couple of weaknesses in Black's pawn structure, so White will have a clear idea of where to play (d5, d6, b6) .

There's no immediate need for this. He wants to play g2-g4-g5 to gain better control of d5.

"White gains by having the open h-file, but Black retains sufficient control of the central squares. It's also less clear where White's king will be safe. After the king-side pawns advanced he wouldn't be expected to O-O, though he might play Ke1-f2. With Black's queen-side pawns far advanced it's highly unlikely he'll O-O-O. On the other hand, Black's king seems perfectly safe, but Rh8 is going to be out of play if Ke8 stays in the middle of that rank.",True," The comment identifies a potential weakness in Black's king safety and suggests a suboptimal pawn structure, indicating a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2.
