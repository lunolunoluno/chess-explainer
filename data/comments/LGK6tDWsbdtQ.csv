"? - Here Steinitz shows poor judgment, since he will be left with a doubled, isolated ""b"" pawn and a weak ""d"" pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by Steinitz, as the doubled, isolated b-pawn and weak d-pawn create significant weaknesses in his position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Ne7 10. Bg5 Nc6 11. Bxd8 Nxd4 12. O-O-O Nb5,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black).

Now Black threatens to come out a pawn ahead by ...Ra6.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies a potential threat to gain a pawn advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Ne7 10. Bg5 Nc6 11. Bxd8 Nxd4 12. O-O-O Nb5 13. Nxb5 axb5 14. Bxc7 Rxa2,"This is a game between Lasker, Em (as White) and Steinitz, W. (as Black).

"Obviously a very bad move, but a difficult one to avoid in view of Black's pawns position. The text not only permanently weakens the ""d"" pawn, but allows White to attack the ""b"" pawn as well.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the weakening of the ""d"" pawn and the potential vulnerability of the ""b"" pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6.

"Enables White to post his Bishop on the diagonal a3-f8. But Black must protect the ""b"" pawn, for White already threatens Rd3-d5.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by identifying the potential threat to Black's ""b"" pawn and the strategic move of White placing their Bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Ne7 10. Bg5 Nc6 11. Bxd8 Nxd4 12. O-O-O Nb5 13. Nxb5 axb5 14. Bxc7 Rxa2 15. Bb6 Be7 16. c3 Kf7 17. Kc2 Rha8 18.

"In contrast to his weak and colorless play in the early part of the game, Steinitz plays now with great energy. Lasker's play however is also on a high level. The object of the text is of course to weaken White's king side pawns.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it only mentions Steinitz's and Lasker's play and the goal of the game.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6.

This move has the merit of semplicity.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as semplicity does not necessarily equate to a good or bad move in chess.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6.

"Resign. La sker's best game in this match. (Comentarios de R. Fine y F. Reinfeld en ""La carrera de ajedrez del Dr. Lasker"")",True,"

The comment suggests that the player should resign, implying that the move was a significant mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bc4 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9.
