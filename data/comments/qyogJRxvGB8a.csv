This game featured a major upset in the U.S. Open. Gabriel Schwartzman is a very talented young Grandmaster but he runs into a creative sacrifice in this game.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as Gabriel Schwartzman, the young Grandmaster, ran into a creative sacrifice, indicating that a significant error occurred in the game.",1. e4,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"
"The old Steinitz variation is enjoying renewed popularity these days. A game between Kasparov and Short at the 1994 Euwe Memorial in Amsterdam had made a deep impression on me, and I was hoping to make use of a plan involving h4, Rh3-g3 and a kingside attack that worked well for Kasparov.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses a different opening variation and a game between other players, rather than addressing the specific move that was played.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"
The pawn sacrifice offered by this move has rarely been tested in the tournament arena. I was quite surprised when Schwartzman accepted it.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the uncommon nature of the pawn sacrifice and the surprise at the opponent's acceptance of it, indicating that it may not have been a sound strategy.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
"This was my own idea. 10.Be2 was recommended in an old book by Harding, but it did not impress me at all. I decided to eliminate the dark-squared bishops and use Kasparov's attacking formation on the kingside.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because they did not mention the move that led to the mistake or why they chose to deviate from the recommended 10.Be2.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on c5"
13...Qe7 would have made it harder for me to justify the investment of the pawn.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player lost material (pawn) for a move that did not contribute to improving their position or gaining a tangible advantage.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b6"
This is a very important move. I need to free the knight from the need to hang around at c3 just to defend the poor pawn.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to be praising the move rather than pointing out a flaw.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
"This eliminates the enemy knight, and I have a decent endgame even without the pawn, because Black is left with a very bad bishop.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake as it highlights the loss of material (the knight) and the strategic advantage gained by the opponent (the bad bishop), which will likely lead to a disadvantageous endgame for the player.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d4"
"There are two points to this move. One is to be ready to transfer to the kingside at a moment's notice, and the other, more subtle, will be revealed shortly.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake as it refers to potential future strategies rather than addressing the immediate error in the previous move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19. Nxd4 Rc8 20. Rbb3,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to b3"
Standard French counterply.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it merely describes a common chess opening.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19. Nxd4 Rc8 20. Rbb3 O-O 21. Rhg3 f6,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f6"
"!? I hadn't worked out all the tactics here. But I had a great deal of confidence and had seen some pleasant long variations, beginning at move 27!",True,"

The comment indicates that the player made a mistake despite having the confidence and knowledge of potential variations, which suggests that they failed to consider all the tactical consequences of their move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19. Nxd4 Rc8 20. Rbb3 O-O 21. Rhg3 f6 22. f5,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f5"
This fell in with my plans. But what about the alternative? Could I have held the position following:,True,"

The comment indicates that the player did not consider alternative moves and now regrets not holding the position, suggesting they recognize the mistake made in their previous move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.

A critical preparatory move before the real attack begins.,False,"

The comment implies that the move was part of a strategy that unfolded later, not a mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9.

Rbc3,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to c3"
The rest of the game is virtually forced.,True,"

The comment indicates that the mistake made by the player led to a situation where the rest of the game was largely determined by the opponent's response, suggesting the mistake had a significant impact on the flow of the game.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.

"Forced, but Black's defenses cannot hold.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake, noting that the move was forced, indicating that Black could not avoid the consequences, and their defense is weak, making the position unsustainable.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"
!! The rook is sacrificed for two pawns and a tremendous attack.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as sacrificing a rook for only two pawns and a potential attack is generally considered a poor move in chess.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.

Last move played: White plays Rook takes on g6 with check"
The attack plays itself!,True,"

The player's move was a tactical oversight, allowing their opponent to gain a significant advantage without any counterplay, hence the comment ""The attack plays itself!"" fits as an explanation of the mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.

Qh6+,"This is a game between Schiller, Eric (as White) and Schwartzman, Gabriel (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h6 with check"
"Black resigned, because once the pieces come off, the f-pawn promotes. Black is powerless to prevent it.",True,". The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating that the move led to a position where Black's f-pawn could promote, leaving Black with no viable defense options.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Bd3 a6 13. h4 Nb6 14. Rh3 Nc4 15. Bxc4 Qxc4 16. a3 b5 17. Ne2 Bd7 18. Nfd4 Nxd4 19.
