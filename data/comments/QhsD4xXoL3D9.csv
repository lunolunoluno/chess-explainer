"Znosko-Borovsky is probably best remembered today for four books that served as texts for the pre-war generation of Soviet players: How to Play the Chess Openings, The Middle Game in Chess, How to Play Chess Endings, and the delightful and irreverent How Not to Play Chess. Mieses, too, was the author of several books including The Chess Pilot, Manual of the End Game, and Instructive Positions from Master Chess. Mieses had a hearty dislike of ""long lines,"" theoretical openings analyzed so deeply that anyone with a good memory could find his way through them. He would frequently trot out the Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3!?) in international competition. Here, he heads for a variation of the Vienna Game that was not sufficiently well explored at that time. His opponent's unfamiliarity with this sideline soon nets Mieses a significant positional advantage.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the player's use of the Danish Gambit, which was not well explored at the time and resulted in a significant positional advantage for the opponent due to their unfamiliarity with this sideline.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3"
"Znosko-Borovsky passes up the opportunity to test Mieses with 3...Nxe4. While it is generally considered harmless for White to take the Knight (4.Nxe4 d5! gets back the piece with a spatial advantage for White), Mieses might well have essayed 4.Nf3!? Nxc3 5.dxc3, the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit, or the extremely complicated lines beginning with 4.Qh5!? Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5!?, which lead to almost unfathomable tactics.",True,"

The comment explains that by not taking the opportunity to challenge Mieses, Znosko-Borovsky missed a chance to potentially gain a significant positional advantage for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
"As an interesting aside, White often reaches this position via the Bishop's Opening without giving Black the opportunity to take on e4, thus: 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nc3, etc.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it clarifies that White did not allow Black the opportunity to take on e4, which would have been a more common and reasonable opening move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d3"
"Here 4...Bc5 would probably transpose into a King's Gambit Declined -- an opening, however, with which the veteran gambitteer Mieses could be expected to be familiar. Znosko-Borovsky's move is designed to start a fight in the center focused on the d5 square. By pinning White's N/c3, Black obtains presumptive control of d5 and is prepared to push his pawn there next move. After, for example, 5.Ne2 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5, Black has achieved the favorable ""Jump Formation"" in the center and can look forward to the middlegame with confidence thanks to his spatial advantage.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting a strategic flaw in the player's move, discussing the potential transpositional opportunities, and outlining the advantages Black should gain in the center with the move 4...Bc5.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4"
"Mieses, not to be outdone, counters by reducing Black's own control over d5.",True,"

The comment correctly highlights a mistake made by the player, as Mieses' move (a knight move to e5) indeed reduces Black's control over the central d5 square.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5"
"This is such a natural-looking move that it is difficult to condemn it. Yet Alekhine, in his annotations to the game Alekhine-Gregory, St. Petersburg, 1909, suggests that Black's strongest course is an immediate 5...h6! with the idea 6.Bxf6 Bxc3+! (before White can play Ne2) 7.bxc3 Qxf6, with equal chances. On the other hand, if White were to meet 5...h6 with 6.Bh4, Black could continue 6...g5 7.Bg3 d5! and, having driven off White's Bishop, he would achieve his central goal and have no further worries.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights a more favorable move (5...h6!) that would have put Black in a better position and provided equal chances, according to Alekhine's annotations.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d6"
"Now that Mieses has taken the time to defend the N/c3 with a fellow steed, the idea of ...h6 is less appealing. White can recapture on c3 with a Knight, and Black's Queen would be exposed after her recapture on f6 since White plans both Nd5 (hitting f6 and c7) and 0-0 with f4! coming.",True,"
The comment accurately describes the tactical downfall of Black after White recaptures on c3 with a Knight, as it highlights the subsequent threats of Nd5 and f4+ aimed at the exposed Black Queen.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
"The tension this move introduces is quite characteristic of Vienna and Giuoco Piano positions. Tarrasch was one of the first people to note that White should not, as a rule, capture on e6: although it doubles Black's pawns, the pawns control important central squares (like d5 -- there's that square again!) and the open f-file is an asset for Black. The two paths most commonly taken are Bb3, defending the B comfortably with the a-pawn, and Mieses's more daring plan here:",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it analyzes a different opening position (Vienna/Giuoco Piano) rather than the current position on the board.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e6"
"Mieses simply completes his development. If Black captures on c4, White will have a death-grip on the d5 square. This is highly uncomfortable for Black! So Znosko-Borovsky puts the question to White's B/g5 instead. Yet perhaps the best move of all for Black is simply 7...Bxc3. This is a difficult point to understand unless you really grasp the niceties of the pawn formation. Black's darksquare Bishop is outside his pawn chain, true: yet it hasn't much of a future where it stands. In the subsequent course of the game, it serves as more of a punching bag for White than an offensive piece. Trading it off might have been the better part of valor.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the strategic implications of the Mieses move, indicating that Black can counter it effectively with 7...Bxc3, despite the apparent weakness it creates for Black's darksquare Bishop.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"
"Already, the B/b4 looks like it is ""floating"" without a purpose. Mieses captures on d5 with his Bishop for a good reason. There is nothing to be gained immediately by kicking Black's N/c6 with a pawn; and long-term, the pawn on d5 might become a liability. Mieses is planning to push f4 soon, harassing Black's Queen and opening a critical file. Notice how weak the f7 square would be if there were no White f-pawn!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the lack of coordination and purpose behind the pawn move, as well as the strategic disadvantages it creates for White.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on d5"
"This prepares for the eventual advance of White's d-pawn. The idea is to soften up the center with f4 first, and if the Black e-pawn can be deflected, then d4 will establish a dominant center for White.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic rationale behind the move, indicating that it is part of a plan to control the center and create opportunities for d4.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c6 with check"
As advertised: White is preparing f4.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as it indicates that White's move was expected to prepare for a f4 pawn push, which suggests that the player has overlooked the potential consequences or missed a better move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to h1"
"Here Mieses makes a small mis-step, which his opponent declines to capitalize on.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Mieses, as it indicates a minor error that the opponent did not take advantage of.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f4"
"This dares Black to snatch a pawn on b2. Yet he might as well grab some booty for his troubles. Mieses could have avoided all of this with 14.d4! and 15.Rxf4, transposing into something like the game continuation without offering Black that opportunity.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the weakness created on Black's b2 pawn and suggests an alternative move to avoid it.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook takes on f4"
Black ducks the challenge. Now White's plan rolls forward unhindered.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Black, recognizing that they missed an opportunity to counter White's strategy effectively.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7"
"What should White play if Black puts the Bishop on d6 now? 15...Bd6 is not the game continuation, but it is worth looking at. The key to this position, as is so often the case in chess, is an undefended man -- here, the pawn on c6. Black's problem is that his Bishop can be forced to go to an undefended square as well, and White can then fork the B and the P. 16.e5 Bb4 17.c3 Ba5 18.Qa4 ... and Black must lose a piece since allowing the fork on c6 is out of the question. For this reason, Black must put his Bishop on b6.",True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the strategic disadvantage of placing the Bishop on d6 and the potential for White to fork the unprotected pawn on c6.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"
But now we can see clearly the sense in which this piece is more of a target than an asset.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player, implying that the move made the piece vulnerable and potentially leading to a loss.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b6"
"Mieses consistently prepares for an assault on the King. Now 16...0-0? is poor, since White has 17.Nf5! and 18.Qg4 with decisive threats on g7 and h6.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by the player, as it points out the inadequate response to White's aggressive threats after 16...0-0.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16. Ng3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to g3"
"Znosko-Borovsky is well aware that the Kingside is an unwelcome home for him, so he spirits his King away to the other side. The castle on the west side of his domain is drafty, but he counts on the fact that he has a clerical defender there and White's pieces are not aimed properly for an assault on the Queenside.",False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player as it seems to be more focused on the player's intentions and positioning rather than the specific move made.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16. Ng3 O-O-O,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: Black plays queenside castle"
"Now White threatens a positional crush with c3 and b4, burying Black's Bishop alive. Even with Black's King ""safe"" on the Queenside, Black cannot hold the game if he is effectively a piece down. This positional threat is very real and it would be sheer suicide to permit White to carry it out. This helps to explain Black's next move, which is otherwise an incomprehensible opening of lines against his own King.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the immediate threat posed by White's potential pawn moves and the inevitable loss of material, despite Black's seemingly safe position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16. Ng3 O-O-O 17. e5,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"
"Black scurries off of the hot file and prepares ...c5, hoping to undermine White's center before Mieses has a chance to reorganize his forces. True, the king is on an open file, but Black has to act fast or White will lock down on c5 and Black will be, practically speaking, a piece down.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, highlighting the urgency of the threat and the potential consequences of not addressing the move quickly.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16.

"This threatens to win a piece, however.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out the aggressive intention of the move that could lead to gaining material advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16.

Now Mieses is truly inspired!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player. It appears to be praising the move rather than explaining why it was a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6.

Black's erstwhile safe shelter is being torn to shreds. Now 21...axb4 is met by 22.a5 Ba7 23.Qa4 and the invaders are already at the gates.,True,"
The comment accurately describes the mistake made by Black, as the move 21...axb4 leaves the king's pawn structure weakened, allowing White to launch an attack with 22.a5 Ba7 23.Qa4.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7. O-O h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. Bxd5 Bc5 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Kh1 d5 13. f4 exf4 14. Rxf4 Qe7 15. d4 Bb6 16.

Seizing the newly-opened file without delay.,True,"

The comment accurately reflects the mistake made by the player, indicating that they rushed into an aggressive move without considering potential defensive counterplay.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3.

Simply glorious -- a fine example of probing both wings at once. White threatens both Rxf7 and Qa6.,False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake. The move may appear aggressive, but without the specific position or the move played, it's difficult to assess if it's a mistake or a strategic decision.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5.

"Black judges that of the two threats, Qa6 is the more deadly. White could play 24.Rxf7 now, a good move, but Mieses is ever searching for the most brilliant continuation. His search is rewarded with...",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by highlighting that Black's move Qa6 is stronger, and White's subsequent move, Rxf7, is a good alternative.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5.

This stunning move enables Mieses to draw Black's King out into the open. Notice that 24...cxb6?? loses to Rxf7.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the consequence of the move 24...cxb6, which allows Rxf7 to win a rook, thus leading to a critical blunder.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3.

"Having garnered a B+P for the Rook, Mieses already has back practically full compensation for the exchange. Of course, he also sacrificed a pawn to open the b-file. But the open file is worth far more to White than the pawn is to Black.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it does not mention the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Bg5 d6 6. Ne2 Be6 7.

White switches sides effortlessly. This whole game exhibits a sort of grace in the attack for which Mieses was justly famous and well-beloved.,False,"
