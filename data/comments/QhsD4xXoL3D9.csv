"Znosko-Borovsky is probably best remembered today for four books that served as texts for the pre-war generation of Soviet players: How to Play the Chess Openings, The Middle Game in Chess, How to Play Chess Endings, and the delightful and irreverent How Not to Play Chess. Mieses, too, was the author of several books including The Chess Pilot, Manual of the End Game, and Instructive Positions from Master Chess. Mieses had a hearty dislike of ""long lines,"" theoretical openings analyzed so deeply that anyone with a good memory could find his way through them. He would frequently trot out the Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3!?) in international competition. Here, he heads for a variation of the Vienna Game that was not sufficiently well explored at that time. His opponent's unfamiliarity with this sideline soon nets Mieses a significant positional advantage.",True," The comment provides context for why the move was considered a mistake, suggesting Mieses’s unusual and potentially detrimental focus on specific openings.",1. e4 e5 2. Nc3,"This is a game between Mieses, J (as White) and Znosko-Borovsky, E (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3",The position is equal,2... Nf6 ,2. Nf3 
"Znosko-Borovsky passes up the opportunity to test Mieses with 3...Nxe4. While it is generally considered harmless for White to take the Knight (4.Nxe4 d5! gets back the piece with a spatial advantage for White), Mieses might well have essayed 4.Nf3!? Nxc3 5.dxc3, the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit, or the extremely complicated lines beginning with 4.Qh5!? Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5!?, which lead to almost unfathomable tactics.",True," The comment clearly identifies a potential tactical blunder and suggests alternative lines that led to a worse position, indicating a flawed evaluation of the move.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Here 4...Bc5 would probably transpose into a King's Gambit Declined -- an opening, however, with which the veteran gambitteer Mieses could be expected to be familiar. Znosko-Borovsky's move is designed to start a fight in the center focused on the d5 square. By pinning White's N/c3, Black obtains presumptive control of d5 and is prepared to push his pawn there next move. After, for example, 5.Ne2 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5, Black has achieved the favorable ""Jump Formation"" in the center and can look forward to the middlegame with confidence thanks to his spatial advantage.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic goal for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

"This is such a natural-looking move that it is difficult to condemn it. Yet Alekhine, in his annotations to the game Alekhine-Gregory, St. Petersburg, 1909, suggests that Black's strongest course is an immediate 5...h6! with the idea 6.Bxf6 Bxc3+! (before White can play Ne2) 7.bxc3 Qxf6, with equal chances. On the other hand, if White were to meet 5...h6 with 6.Bh4, Black could continue 6...g5 7.Bg3 d5! and, having driven off White's Bishop, he would achieve his central goal and have no further worries.",True," The comment provides a counter-argument to the initial mistake, suggesting a more strategic alternative.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Now that Mieses has taken the time to defend the N/c3 with a fellow steed, the idea of ...h6 is less appealing. White can recapture on c3 with a Knight, and Black's Queen would be exposed after her recapture on f6 since White plans both Nd5 (hitting f6 and c7) and 0-0 with f4! coming.",True," The comment highlights a strategic flaw, suggesting a weak plan and potential vulnerability to counterattack.",1. e4 e5 2.

"The tension this move introduces is quite characteristic of Vienna and Giuoco Piano positions. Tarrasch was one of the first people to note that White should not, as a rule, capture on e6: although it doubles Black's pawns, the pawns control important central squares (like d5 -- there's that square again!) and the open f-file is an asset for Black. The two paths most commonly taken are Bb3, defending the B comfortably with the a-pawn, and Mieses's more daring plan here:",True," The comment offers insightful analysis of the move's strategic implications, suggesting a potential weakness in White's opening choice.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Mieses simply completes his development. If Black captures on c4, White will have a death-grip on the d5 square. This is highly uncomfortable for Black! So Znosko-Borovsky puts the question to White's B/g5 instead. Yet perhaps the best move of all for Black is simply 7...Bxc3. This is a difficult point to understand unless you really grasp the niceties of the pawn formation. Black's darksquare Bishop is outside his pawn chain, true: yet it hasn't much of a future where it stands. In the subsequent course of the game, it serves as more of a punching bag for White than an offensive piece. Trading it off might have been the better part of valor.",True," The comment offers a nuanced explanation of the mistake, highlighting a strategic disadvantage and a potential tactical opportunity for Black.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Already, the B/b4 looks like it is ""floating"" without a purpose. Mieses captures on d5 with his Bishop for a good reason. There is nothing to be gained immediately by kicking Black's N/c6 with a pawn; and long-term, the pawn on d5 might become a liability. Mieses is planning to push f4 soon, harassing Black's Queen and opening a critical file.

"This prepares for the eventual advance of White's d-pawn.

"What should White play if Black puts the Bishop on d6 now? 15...Bd6 is not the game continuation, but it is worth looking at. The key to this position, as is so often the case in chess, is an undefended man -- here, the pawn on c6.

"Znosko-Borovsky is probably best remembered today for four books that served as texts for the pre-war generation of Soviet players: How to Play the Chess Openings, The Middle Game in Chess, How to Play Chess Endings, and the delightful and irreverent How Not to Play Chess. Mieses, too, was the author of several books including The Chess Pilot, Manual of the End Game, and Instructive Positions from Master Chess. Mieses had a hearty dislike of ""long lines,"" theoretical openings analyzed so deeply that anyone with a good memory could find his way through them. He would frequently trot out the Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3!?) in international competition. Here, he heads for a variation of the Vienna Game that was not sufficiently well explored at that time. His opponent's unfamiliarity with this sideline soon nets Mieses a significant positional advantage.",True," The comment identifies a potential tactical error by reducing Black’s control, suggesting a miscalculation.",1. e4 e5 2.
