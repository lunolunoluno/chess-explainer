The French Winawer. In theory it is solid yet aggressive. You choose an older inflexible way to meet it (and more difficult to defend against). Typically White will unleash a strong Kingside attack with Qg4.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it simply describes the potential response for White without addressing the specific move made by Black.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4,-
"This move makes sense. Objectively it may be questionable but it offers Black two pluses. First it gives Black the half-open c - file. Second it breaks up the White center pawns. One reason for questioning this move is that it does not appear to be consistent with the objectives of Black's choice of opening. Always remember there is a plus in every negative on the chessboard. Chess is an exchange of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, if you drop a piece you generally get two moves in exchange for it. Sometimes the two moves are more critical than the piece. It is the reason that sacrifices work. That is why chess coaches warn younger players to not chase pawns. It is not worth the moves that are given up. In the games that I've seen, it appears that Black wants a quick resolution to the game by choosing this move.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it praises the move rather than identifying the flaw.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on d4,-
"Interesting try for Black, typically the play would be either /\Nc6 or /\Ba5. Again the move makes sense, but remember in chess that there is an absolute truth at work. Wrong moves should be punished by accurate play.",False,"

The comment does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player, as it only refers to alternative options without specifying why the chosen move was a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on c3 with check,-
At this point the idea would be to play Qg3. The forcing of the /\g6 gives White a huge positional advantage with the pawn at e5 and the absence of the Black's dark square Bishop. If Black castles Kingside he should not be able to defend himself. Nf3,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as playing Qg3 would indeed create a significant positional advantage by attacking the pivotal e5 pawn and limiting Black's options for castling Kingside.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to b5," White plays Qg3, which could lead to a disadvantageous situation. By doing so, White forces Black's king to castle Kingside, leaving it weak. Moreover, without the dark square bishop, Black's position is compromised. Moving the knight to f3 could also become problematic for White if Black develops appropriately."
"This move is too ambitious at this point. Now Black will be stuck with an over-extended pawn. In the French, Black must defend first, THEN attack. Development was essential on move 9. Again a move that makes sense. 9/\d4 is not as bad as you think. The move is not an ""attack."" Pawn moves are seldom for purposes of ""attack."" As a general rule, the idea of the pawn move is to gain or control space. I do however agree that this move is ill timed and too ambitious. In a sense the pawn is sacrificed for open lines. The problem for Black is that these open lines benefit White! BTW, in every defense the idea is to ""defend first, THEN attack."" All attacks must have positional justification. Black does have a problem unraveling his development in the French Defense - your opponent compounds this natural problem. This is why I do not personal recommend the French Defense you young players. If you are interested in completely frustrating someone playing the French Defense try the ""Exchange Variation."" It takes all the fun out of it for Black.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake by highlighting the problems with the pawn move, suggesting its timing and ambition were poor, and offering a better defensive approach in the French Defense.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 d4,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d4," The recent move by Black to d4 is premature and could lead to overextension. In the French Defense, Black's priority should be on establishing a solid defense, then advancing with an attack. Moving the pawn on move 9 seems aggressive, but pawn advances are usually about gaining control rather than attacking. While it opens lines that could be advantageous for White, this move doesn't align with strategic positioning. Black's development in the French Defense is already challenging, and this move exacerbates the issue. It's critical to always aim for a well-founded attack. If your goal is to disrupt Black's comfort in the French, consider using the ""Exchange Variation."""
"Black's develop ment is now becoming less effective because his pieces are being pinned and becoming useless. Black is cramped but at this point is fine. Do not mistake a cramped position for a bad position. Some defenses are specifically designed to make maxim use of as little space as possible. These can be very tough to crack and if the attacker relaxes or mishandles the position, it could get real ugly real fast. One characteristic of a cramped position is the interlocking of pieces. This is called ""over protection."" The idea is that for every attacker on a piece there is at least one more defender. This makes the various pieces more flexible - you can move any defender and not give up material. About pins: You place a high value on them for good reason. Pins often decide the game! There are two types of pins. There is the ""absolute"" pin. These are pins where the first piece can not move because the King is behind it. Then there is the ""relative"" pin where the defender can choose to give up material. The difference is that the second is flexible while the first is not. The ""magic"" behind the pin is the inflexibility of the pinned piece and generally its' defender. With one piece you can tie up as many as three defenders! That's like playing a virtual piece or two ahead. Another thing to like about pins is that they can quickly become a permanent positional advantage. Once you get a pin, work on the front piece - start piling up the attack on it.",True,"

The comment provides a clear explanation of why the move was a mistake, focusing on the pinning of pieces and the cramped position affecting Black's defensive capabilities, which aligns with the mistake made in the move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 d4 9. Qd3 Ne7 10. Bg5,This is a game between W39 (as White) and B39 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5," In this situation, White is executing a strategic maneuver by moving their bishop to g5. Black's development has been less effective as their pieces now face pins, rendering them less effective. While Black might seem to be in a cramped position, it does not necessarily mean it's a poor position. Certain defenses thrive in such tight spaces, making them difficult to penetrate. A characteristic of such conditions is ""over protection"" where the interlocking of pieces, due to pins, makes the pieces more versatile; moving one defender doesn't compromise material strength. Pins are highly valued in chess as they can dictate the game's flow. Understanding the difference between absolute and relative pins is key, with absolute pins being non-negotiable and relative pins offering some flexibility. Once a pin is established, focusing on the pinned piece can turn it into a dominant advantage."
"Missing /\Qa5+ and /\Nxe5. The stronger of the two would be /\Nxe5, completely dissolving the White center and freeing Black's game. The draw back is that it scrambles the Black pawns and leaves White with a 2 - 3 pawn island advantage. The question is if a free game and an advantage in the center would be worth it?",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the missed opportunities for a strong central control and potential game transformation with the move /Nxe5.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6," ""The move played by Black was not optimal. A stronger move for Black would have been exchanging pawns at e5, which could have disrupted the White center and opened up the game for Black. However, this move also risks leaving Black with a fragmented pawn structure and a significant pawn disadvantage. The question arises: Is the potential control of the center and a more active position worth these pawn weaknesses?"""
"Bxc6 0-0-0 0-0 Black should have tried 13/\Qd5. This makes use of the earlier /\d4 move. 14. Qxd4 Qxd4 15.Nxd4 Bxg2 16.

A bolt from the blue for Black! My intuition kept nagging at me to play 15. Bf6, so I had to use almost half of my time to give the gut feeling a green light. You knew better, generally your first instincts are correct. The old rule of thumb is ""long analysis is wrong analysis"" at the board. This drops a piece. Let's examine why the move is not good. First, it gives away the Bishop for a pawn without time advantage. Second, it does not force anything. When you sacrifice it must be forcing. Black is not obliged to capture. gxf6 Qg3+ Ng6 Here Black, in essence, blunders the game away. 16/\Kh7 17. exf6 Ng6 and Black is home free with extra material. Nxg6 fxg6?

Qxg6+ Kh8 Qxh6+ If I couldn't find an absolute win, I knew I could at least give perpetual check. Attitude check. When you have your opponent in your sights never, never, never consider the draw. In fact, never consider a draw until you are absolutely sure the position is completely lifeless - or you are tricking your opponent out of half a point. Even in completely lost positions there is value in playing them out - you learn a lot by the hard spots in life. Don't pass up your best learning opportunities. Kg8 Qg6+ Kh8 Re3 Bxg2 The only move that can prevent an immediate mate by 22. Rh3+ Rg1! Rg8?? Congratulations! You finished with a good score. In this game you took advantage of your opponents weakness/ mistakes. You were also aggressive and willing to take a risk. You must study the ""positional"" aspects of the game. To attack you must have positional justification. To sacrifice material you should have concrete analysis all the way through to checkmate. Also when you sacrifice focus on forcing moves. You showed excellent insight into some ideas in the game and you made sure your position was solid. Once you get a grip on the positional essence and learning how to read the board, you'll be a match for just about anyone under the Master level. Qh6#",True,"
