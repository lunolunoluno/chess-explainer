1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4,"The French Winawer. In theory it is solid yet aggressive. You choose an
older inflexible way to meet it (and more difficult to defend against).
Typically White will unleash a strong Kingside attack with Qg4.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4,"This move makes sense. Objectively it may be questionable but it
offers Black two pluses. First it gives Black the half-open c - file. Second
it breaks up the White center pawns. One reason for questioning this move is
that it does not appear to be consistent with the objectives of Black's choice
of opening. Always remember there is a plus in every negative on the
chessboard. Chess is an exchange of advantages and disadvantages. For instance,
if you drop a piece you generally get two moves in exchange for it. Sometimes
the two moves are more critical than the piece. It is the reason that
sacrifices work. That is why chess coaches warn younger players to not chase
pawns. It is not worth the moves that are given up. In the games that I've
seen, it appears that Black wants a quick resolution to the game by choosing
this move.",False
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+,"Interesting try for Black, typically the play would
be either /\Nc6 or /\Ba5. Again the move makes sense, but remember in chess
that there is an absolute truth at work. Wrong moves should be punished by
accurate play.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5,"At this point the idea would be to play
Qg3. The forcing of the /\g6 gives White a huge positional advantage with the
pawn at e5 and the absence of the Black's dark square Bishop. If Black castles
Kingside he should not be able to defend himself. Nf3",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 d4,"This move is too
ambitious at this point. Now Black will be stuck with an over-extended pawn.
In the French, Black must defend first, THEN attack. Development was essential
on move 9. Again a move that makes sense. 9/\d4 is not as bad as you think.
The move is not an ""attack."" Pawn moves are seldom for purposes of ""attack.""
As a general rule, the idea of the pawn move is to gain or control space. I do
however agree that this move is ill timed and too ambitious. In a sense the
pawn is sacrificed for open lines. The problem for Black is that these open
lines benefit White! BTW, in every defense the idea is to ""defend first, THEN
attack."" All attacks must have positional justification. Black does have a
problem unraveling his development in the French Defense - your opponent
compounds this natural problem. This is why I do not personal recommend the
French Defense you young players. If you are interested in completely
frustrating someone playing the French Defense try the ""Exchange Variation.""
It takes all the fun out of it for Black.",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 d4 9. Qd3 Ne7 10. Bg5,"Black's develop
ment is now becoming less effective because his pieces are being pinned and
becoming useless. Black is cramped but at this point is fine. Do not mistake a
cramped position for a bad position. Some defenses are specifically designed
to make maxim use of as little space as possible. These can be very tough to
crack and if the attacker relaxes or mishandles the position, it could get
real ugly real fast. One characteristic of a cramped position is the
interlocking of pieces. This is called ""over protection."" The idea is that for
every attacker on a piece there is at least one more defender. This makes the
various pieces more flexible - you can move any defender and not give up
material. About pins: You place a high value on them for good reason. Pins
often decide the game! There are two types of pins. There is the ""absolute""
pin. These are pins where the first piece can not move because the King is
behind it. Then there is the ""relative"" pin where the defender can choose to
give up material. The difference is that the second is flexible while the
first is not. The ""magic"" behind the pin is the inflexibility of the pinned
piece and generally its' defender. With one piece you can tie up as many as
three defenders! That's like playing a virtual piece or two ahead. Another
thing to like about pins is that they can quickly become a permanent
positional advantage. Once you get a pin, work on the front piece - start
piling up the attack on it.",True

the two would be /\Nxe5, completely dissolving the White center and freeing
Black's game. The draw back is that it scrambles the Black pawns and leaves
White with a 2 - 3 pawn island advantage. The question is if a free game and
an advantage in the center would be worth it?",True
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 d4 9. Qd3 Ne7 10. Bg5 a6 11. Bxc6+,"Bxc6 0-0-0 0-0 Black

Qxd4 15.Nxd4 Bxg2 16. Rhg1 Be4 and Black has placed his Bishop on a dominating
square can go just about anywhere unhindered. This pivot point is critical. On
15. Rxd4 then Bxf3 is strong for Black. Nh4 h6 Bf6! A bolt from the blue for
Black! My intuition kept nagging at me to play 15. Bf6, so I had to use almost
half of my time to give the gut feeling a green light. You knew better,
generally your first instincts are correct. The old rule of thumb is ""long
analysis is wrong analysis"" at the board. This drops a piece. Let's examine
why the move is not good. First, it gives away the Bishop for a pawn without
time advantage. Second, it does not force anything. When you sacrifice it must
be forcing. Black is not obliged to capture. gxf6 Qg3+ Ng6 Here Black, in
essence, blunders the game away. 16/\Kh7 17. exf6 Ng6 and Black is home free
with extra material. Nxg6 fxg6? This was Black's last chance to defend himself
by not taking back the Knight and moving his King over to the h-file, giving
up the Exchange. You got that right! Qxg6+ Kh8 Qxh6+ If I couldn't find an
absolute win, I knew I could at least give perpetual check. Attitude check.
When you have your opponent in your sights never, never, never consider the
draw. In fact, never consider a draw until you are absolutely sure the
position is completely lifeless - or you are tricking your opponent out of
half a point. Even in completely lost positions there is value in playing them
out - you learn a lot by the hard spots in life. Don't pass up your best
learning opportunities. Kg8 Qg6+ Kh8 Re3 Bxg2 The only move that can prevent
an immediate mate by 22. Rh3+ Rg1! Rg8?? Congratulations! You finished with a
good score. In this game you took advantage of your opponents weakness/
mistakes. You were also aggressive and willing to take a risk. You must study
the ""positional"" aspects of the game. To attack you must have positional
justification. To sacrifice material you should have concrete analysis all the
way through to checkmate. Also when you sacrifice focus on forcing moves. You
showed excellent insight into some ideas in the game and you made sure your
position was solid. Once you get a grip on the positional essence and learning
how to read the board, you'll be a match for just about anyone under the
Master level. Qh6#",True
