"The idea of the opening is to create an imbalance and develop around it. White needs to capitalize on Black's dark square weakness and launch a Kingside attack.

"6. e5 is tempting. To play this move White must answer two questions: 1.) Can I survive the attack on the a8 - h1 diagonal? 2.) Can I maintain the pawn on e5?

"Ideas for White's improvement: There seems to be a good feel for traps. However the strongest continuations were not chosen. Study in pattern recognition would be useful to see ideas ""automatically."" Work on the concept of ""imbalances"" more. The idea of planting the Knight on c6 was a good example of attempting to gain the superior minor piece. In a sense this made the difference in the game. Even though both players generally mishandled it, it was enough to gain the victory. White needs to consider the possibilities along the diagonals before moving. Being ""diagonally challenged"" will lose many games. Examples of this weakness: Allowing Black the opportunity to launch a Queen side attack with b4, missing the Black win of the Knight on c6 by cutting off the diagonal, missing the final nail of Qc6.
