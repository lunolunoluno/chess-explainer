"Unlike a Sicilian or French Defense here Black firmly places a pawn in front of Pe4, and says ""no further"". White has tried some extreme measures, such as a King's Gambit, to get rid of Pe5, but the more common approach these days is to apply pressure to Black's position all over the board.",True," The comment identifies a specific strategic error and suggests a more typical approach to Black’s defense, indicating a misunderstanding of the typical response to a Sicilian or French attack.",1. e4 e5,"This is a game between Anand, Viswanathan (as White) and Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as Black).

"This is a modest move which leaves the bishop capable of moving to c3 to back up Pe5 or simply guarding square f4.

"With Ph3 White restrains Black's light-square bishop. With Bd2 & Ne4 he restrains Black's dark-square bishop. This is sensible, but far from an indication of how he might win the game.
