1. e4 e5,"Unlike a Sicilian or French Defense here Black firmly places a pawn in front of Pe4, and says ""no further"". White has tried some extreme measures, such as a King's Gambit, to get rid of Pe5, but the more common approach these days is to apply pressure to Black's position all over the board.",True

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6,"This is the Berlin Defense.
