"B25: Closed Sicilian: 3 g3, lines without early Be3",True,"

The comment suggests that the player missed an important preparatory move (Be3) in the Sicilian Defense, which could lead to less favorable positions and missed opportunities.",1. e4,"This is a game between Spassky, Boris V (as White) and Polgar, Judit (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e4"," Black plays a move that isn't recommended in the Closed Sicilian opening. They've chosen 3.g3, which is an unconventional choice and deviates from the main lines. The comment suggests that this move doesn't support the idea of not playing early Be3, which could have led to more solid development and positioning."
