A modest little move. White intends to build a long-term advantage.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because building a long-term advantage does not justify a poorly evaluated move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5 5. c4 dxc4 6.

Karpov obviously doesn't like the idea of Kasparov fixing the a-pawn with a ..Qa4.,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by Karpov, as it indicates a potential weakness by moving the a-pawn with..Qa4, which may not be the best strategic move in this context.",1. d4 Nf6 2.

"In the nick of time. Without this move, White would have an impossible job to hold the position. Left to his own devices, Kasparov would build-up on the c and a-pawns with ..Rc4 leaving White with an awkward defence.",True,"
The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, highlighting the potential consequences of the move and the alternative strategy suggested.",1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"Karpov even pointed out here he successfully defended a similar position in the 1971 Alekhine Memorial against Tal - and that went on for 103 moves! There was no such chance of that here, particularly as Kasparov had already won the tournament!",False,"

The comment references Karpov's past successful defense in a different tournament and does not directly address the specific mistake made by the player in the current game.",1. d4 Nf6 2.
