Nc3,This is a game between Pillsbury (as White) and Marco (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c3

Pinning the knight and putting more pressure on d5. Pillsbury was the first to demonstrate this is the best move.,True,"

Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7,This is a game between Pillsbury (as White) and Marco (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7

Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 b6 7. Bd3,This is a game between Pillsbury (as White) and Marco (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3
White must not delay this move or Black will play dxc4 and his bishop will be very active. The recommended move now is 8... Nxd5 followed by 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Nxd5 exd5. Black avoids 10... Bxd5 because of 11. e4 and White would control the center.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting the correct moves for Black after White's poor decision.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 b6 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. cxd5,This is a game between Pillsbury (as White) and Marco (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d5

This provides strong support for the knight and opens the way for a kingside attack.,False,"

"A strategic error: Black relieves the tension in the center. Black's queenside attack is no match for White's kingside attack.""",False,"
