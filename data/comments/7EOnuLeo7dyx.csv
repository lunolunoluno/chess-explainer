"This is a standard position from the Sicilian Defense, but with colors reversed and a tempo down, and that is enough to confuse Deep Blue.

Having sidelined the bishop Kasparov retreats his knight preparing to storm his pawns down the board on the kingside.

"It's hard to say what this move is about. It might be that Deep Blue envisages a time when the position will open up, in which case the king is best placed tucked away in the corner.",True," The comment suggests a potential strategic goal, indicating a flawed assessment of the position's long-term implications.",1. d3 e5 2.

The point of h4 was to keep Black's bishop from moving to g5 from where it controls c1 and can settle on e3.

White's strategy is directed against the bishop on g6: he wants to bury it by playing the pawn to f5.,True, The comment suggests a specific tactical error – burying the bishop – which is a clear indication of a flawed strategic decision.,1. d3 e5 2.

Kasparov has a powerful pawn center; he has a knight which is itching to leap into d5 once Black's knight can be shifted from f6; and Black's bishops have no scope at all. A human with this position against Kasparov would feel completely demoralized.,True," The comment accurately describes a potential weakness in the position, suggesting a lack of initiative and strategic options for Black.",1. d3 e5 2.

This is the crucial move. Black's position is cut in two. There is little connection between kingside and queenside which is potentially extremely dangerous for Black's king. Although Kasparov is a pawn down his superbly placed knight and bishop almost single-handedly dominate Black's pieces (with a bit of help from the pawn on f6).,True," The comment accurately identifies a critical weakness in Black's position, suggesting a vulnerability that directly impacts the king’s safety.",1. d3 e5 2.
