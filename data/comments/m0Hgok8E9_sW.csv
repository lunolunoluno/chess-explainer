This is a major opening error. This pawn move does not aid in development and blocks the best King Knight move. It does not develop a piece. It does not control central squares (1/\f5 for instance does). It creates weakness on the Kingside.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake in the move, explaining the lack of development, control of central squares, and the potential weakness it creates on the player's side.",1. Nf3 f6,This is a game between W45 (as White) and B45 (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f6
"Interesting and ""correct."" Unfortunately ""correct"" in chess is not always the ""best."" When an opponent is cobbled up like this ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! Here 4.e4 leads to a significant advantage due to White's central control and Black's lack of development. h2-h3 ""Lasker's rule"" states: ""Always distrust a pawn move."" The reason is that all pawn moves change the game, forever. You can move any piece back and forth, but when a pawn moves it can't go back. Thus you see the permanent nature of the pawn move. Many players in your class tend to be afraid of ""shadow"" threats (/\Bg5). Silman's rule is ""if you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it."" Lasker urged, ""defend with as little effort as possible."" Typically this pin is an illusion, especially before a person castles. It's only real purpose is to control the dark squares on the Kingside (and possibly the center). a2-a3 Having protected the Kingside, you now seal off the Queenside. While this seems prudent you must remember a simple idea. Now repeat after me, ""always play in the center."" Remind yourself that if you do not play in the center you will spend eternity attempting to win the E class at your local tournament. It is a simple concept, but it is amazing how few of us catch on to it. Only play on the side if there is a GM approved reason. f4-d2 Not bad but it is a waste of a good move. Why did you put your bishop on f4 to begin with? To control the middle? To control the Queenside? Well, then what is it doing on d2? You have just wasted a good wish (to get to move twice in a game - here was that extra move you wanted). If you were to play Bg3/h2 then you could still do the control thing. e2-e3",True,"

The comment accurately highlights that the move e2-e3 doesn't aid in controlling the center or developing pieces, which are crucial aspects of chess strategy. It also suggests better alternatives to improve the position.",1. Nf3 f6 2. Nc3 c6 3. d4 d5 4. Bf4,This is a game between W45 (as White) and B45 (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4
"Count the pawn moves your opponent has made so far. Because the game remains closed Black survives 60 moves longer than he should have. When you see this many pointless moves from your opponent, show no mercy. Go after him, sacrifice material to open lines if you have to. These are easy points! f1-b5+ c8-d7 b5xa6 Interesting choice. I like it. It creates some interesting possibilities on the Queenside.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on the opponent's strategy rather than providing insight into the player's error.",1. Nf3 f6 2. Nc3 c6 3. d4 d5 4.

f8xc5 b2-b4 Fingers off the wing pawns! d1-e2 Again missing the chance to crack the game open with 13. e4 c3xb5 a6xb5 e2xb5+ Good exchange idea! f3-d4,True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake of moving the pawn to b4 and explains the missed opportunity to initiate a strong exchange with 13. e4, which could have significantly improved the player's position.",1.

"b5xd7+ I'm not a fan. Typically when you are up the idea is to avoid exchanges in favor of building pressure. Then there is the idea that once a material advantage is obtained trade into oblivion. It takes experience to know which to employ and when. The key to this is to know how to win an endgame. When you can go into a ""won"" endgame, but all means go for it! The fewer pieces in the middle game the easier the defense - typically. This move shows lack of confidence. If you lose make sure it is not due to lack of courage (Tal, if I remember correctly.) O-O Allowing Black to equalize immediately. Black has all sorts of weaknesses and while you can castle you do not have to castle! I know we preach that you should castle as soon as possible but that is only part of the idea. The complete context is to castle as soon as safely possible with a reason. In other words, play with the end in mind. Play with a plan. What does the position demand? 18.Bc3! attacks Black's confused Kingside. g8-e7 a1-e1 e6-e5 d4-f3 e7-f5? Black gives up the initiative. /\Rac8 is the move. e3-e4 d5xe4 e1xe4 h8-e8? Giving White more targets than can be possibly covered. c2-c4 Another good idea is 23. g4. c4-c5 Excellent. I like how Silman encourages, ""when you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it!"" Now you have the luxury of ignoring further threats. d2-c3 b5 gives White two passed pawns and serious attacking potential on the Queenside. For instance Bd1 then B anywhere/\. f1-d1+ d7-c6 c3xb4 a8-d8 d1xd8 Rxd8 gives up the d-file. 28.Ree1 is best. g2-g4 f5-h4 f3xh4 g5xh4 a3-a4 d8-b8 a4-a5 b8-d8 a5-a6 Sure is fun when all your opponent can do is move back and forth! But I like getting the Rook behind the pawns or invading with the King. c7-b8 b4-a5 Ba3! d8-d1+ g1-g2 d1-a1 e4-b4 b8-a7 b4-b7 a7xc5 b7-c7+ c6-b5 c7-b7+ Attacking when the position does not justify an attack. This actually loses a piece to /\Kd6. Either way, by attacking without positional justification you allow a winning advantage to vaporize. a5-c3 a1-a3 c3-b2 a3-a2 /\Kxb7 42.Bxa3 Bxa3 wins a piece. b7-b8 a6-a7 Missing /\Bb6 43.Ra8+ Be7. Now 44.Bxb7 (or any other Bishop move) Rxf2+ destroying White's position. b8-b5 c5-b6 b2-c1 this should lose to / \Rxf2+ a2xf2+ g2-h1 f2-f1+ h1-g2 f1xc1 b5-d5 c1-c2+ g2-f3 c2-c3+ f3-g2 c3-c2+ g2-f3 c2-c4 d5-d7+ a7-a6 d7-h7 c4-f4+ f3-e2 f4-f2+ e2-e1 e5-e4 h6 f2-g2 h6xf6 g2-h2 g4-g5",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player by suggesting alternative moves that would have been more strategic, such as attacking the opponent's position and building pressure without giving up material, ultimately indicating that the move b5xd7 was a poor choice.",1.

"e2-f1 f7-f3 g3xf3+ h4-g4 f3-g3+ g4-f4 g3xg7 f4-f3 g7-f7+ f3-e4 e3-e2 Coaches Advice: Your road to chess improvement is through Karpov and his type. You must become addicted to ""positional"" chess. You attacked when you should not have, you traded when you should not have, and you castled when you had a much better move. Study Silman's ""How to Reassess your Chess"" (easily the most useful book on chess in the last 200 years), ""The Amateur's Mind,"" and ""How to/ \ Workbook. "" In a sense, I'm asking you to go back to ""square one"" and relearn the game. The idea is to teach you to play with a plan. It is said that a ""bad"" plan is better than no plan. When I say plan, it's not a legalism that controls every thought. But there are some basic ideas like knowing when to attack and when to defend that are critical. The cool part about this is once you have the positional ideas down, you can attack like a mad dog when the position calls for it. If you don't know then you will not pull off the brilliant attacks when they are available. One piece of advice that will add 200 points to your playing strength right now. ALWAYS (unless there is a specific GM approved reason) PLAY IN THE CENTER! If you lose the center, you lose the game. The center controls the game. The center is your brain, you lose your brain/\. OK you get the picture. You will be surprised when you get this one concept down with a passion that you will be able to play with anybody. (Or at least you will get that feeling.) You will also be alegitimate threat to anyone (just don't look at the rating, it messes with your mind). While you are doing this, consider what openings you do well when playing. While 1.Nf3 is a very good opening you must understand the ideas behind what you are attempting to accomplish with it. Many players are looking for a win in the first 10 moves. If this is you then 1.Nf3 is not our opening. If you are real good at endgames then your best route is probably 1.e4 (assuming you can live through the typically violent middle games). If you like positional chess then head for the closed games you find in 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.d4. 1.f4. If you really like odd ideas stick to 1.c4 (English) and 1.f4 (Bird) but I wouldn't stray beyond those (possibly 1.Nc3 the Dunst is playable.) The reason for this advice is that many players like an opening, for whatever reason, and do poorly in it (typically because they 1. Do not understand it. 2. Do not feel comfortable in the game. 3. Are not capable of grasping the concepts). For instance, I attempted to play the Modern Benoni and was constantly beaten. My problem is that I did not have the maturity in the areas that were necessary to play the opening. Nothing personal, but the Benoni lived up to its name (son of my sorrow). Meanwhile they rule with an opening that they, for whatever reason, do not like. I used to play the English but abandoned it for more popular openings. A while back I did an inventory and discovered that I did well in English type positions and won 80% of my games. So when I'm in an important game that I want to win, what opening do I play? (Hint: It's not 1.e4!) e4-d3",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the player's mistake in the move e4-d3 as a lack of understanding of the concepts necessary for success in the game, such as knowing when to attack and when to defend, and suggests that the player should focus on learning positional chess and playing in the center, which are essential for becoming a stronger player.",1.
