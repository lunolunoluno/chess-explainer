"The following game is, I think, a very instructive and thematic example of what black is playing for in the King's Gambit with 3...g5. All of black's strategy is based around keeping the ""weakling"" pawn on f4 alive, because from a dynamic point of view it is incredibly annoying. Therefore, it is also a nice illustration of modern chess.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic rationale for black's move, but it doesn't explicitly state why the move was incorrect.",1. e4,"This is a game between Nunn, John (as White) and Timman, Jan (as Black).

"This is not necessarily better than 5...Nf6, but, to the extent that it is the beginning of a thematic plan black implements very nicely in this game, it deserves an exclam. Black has to choose between staying a pawn ahead and keeping the easy to protect g4-pawn, or allowing white to equalize material while the weak f4-pawn continues its precarious existence. He makes the dynamic choice because the f4-pawn is a great nuisance for white, blocking the f-file and the dark-squared bishop.",True," The comment offers insight into the strategic considerations behind the move, highlighting the pawn structure and the potential for a dynamic exchange.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

"White decides he would like to be a pawn ahead, but in doing so he spends precious time and fails to solve the problem of exactly how to develop.

"White approaches the position thus; the b2-pawn is immune because of Qxa7 in conjunction with Rb1, so it's time to finish development by mobilizing his rooks, and to get out of danger. Apparently it was better to be greedy with 17.Bxe4 or even 17.dxe4. The main idea would be to stop black's next, but it is hard to imagine white ever exploiting his extra pawn on the kingside since he is under so much pressure there.",True," The comment offers a justification for the mistake, suggesting a strategic miscalculation and an overreliance on a pawn sacrifice, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.
