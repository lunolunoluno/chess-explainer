"I think, this is a more flexible continuation compared to the classical 5...Qb6, for Black keeps a possibility to develop his queen on the square c7, intending to play against the pawn e5 by f7-f6.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it suggests a better continuation rather than explaining an error.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d7"
"White planned a strike c3-c4, so Black radically prevents it, bearing in mind that it is difficult for a white knight to occupy the ideal square d4, because the pawn e5 is weak.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake, as it points out that White's plan to play c3-c4 was thwarted by Black, and it highlights the potential weakness of the e5 pawn.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c4"
"Looking closely not only to the pawn e5, but also to the square f2.",True,"

The comment specifies potential threats to the pawn at e5 and the square f2, which suggests that the player might have neglected these factors and made a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to h6"
"White has strengthened his outpost on the square e5 and intends to drive the enemy knight from c6, in order to activate his ""runner"" on the square d4. Black needs to undertake counter-actions quickly.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the strategic intent of White's move and suggests a potential counter-strategy for Black.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to e2"
Setting up an ambush - to attack the square f2,True,"
The comment correctly identifies the mistake as an attempt to attack the weak f2 square, which is a common tactical motive in chess.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to f8"
"After the white king has moved to the square h1, a pawn attack becomes more effective.",False,"

The comment does not explain a mistake made by the player, as moving the king to h1 is not a common or recommended move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8 16. Kh1 g5,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
"Preventing files opening: if g5-g4, then h3-h4.",True,"
The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests a strategic move (h3-h4) to prevent the opponent's file opening (g5-g4).",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8 16. Kh1 g5 17. a4 a5 18. b5 Ne7 19. Nf1 h5 20. Nd4,"This is a game between Alekseev, Evgeny (as White) and Ivanov, Sergey (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d4"
An important achievement of Black: now White is forced to exchange his light-square bishop.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it describes a potential strategic situation without addressing the specific error in the move played.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8 16. Kh1 g5 17. a4 a5 18. b5 Ne7 19. Nf1 h5 20. Nd4 Rfg8 21.

"Threatening was 24...Qd8, and the pawn h4 is defenceless.",True,"
The comment correctly identifies the mistake of leaving the pawn on h4 defenseless after the queen move to d8, which could lead to a disadvantageous position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8 16. Kh1 g5 17. a4 a5 18. b5 Ne7 19. Nf1 h5 20. Nd4 Rfg8 21.

"The position seems to be even. Pawn chains enclose all the board, making breakthroughs into an alien camp difficult. Nevertheless, Black has some possibilities to reinforce his pieces; for example, he can transmit his light-square bishop along the route d7-e8-g6 and double his rooks on the file f. Also the pawn e5 is weak, and White has to play extremely careful.",False,"

The comment does not identify the specific mistake made by the player; it merely provides strategic suggestions and general advice for Black's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 fxe5 10. dxe5 c4 11. Bc2 Bc5 12. Nbd2 Nh6 13. b4 Bb6 14. h3 Nf7 15. Qe2 Rdf8 16. Kh1 g5 17. a4 a5 18. b5 Ne7 19. Nf1 h5 20. Nd4 Rfg8 21.

"White doesn't feel danger. Neccessary was 27. Bc1, and if 27...Bc7, then 28. Bf4.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the missed opportunity to play 27. Bc1, which would have countered Black's potential plan with 27...Bc7 followed by 28. Bf4, putting pressure on Black's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7. Bd3 Qc7 8.

"White has to permit the opening of the file g, for not to lose the pawn e5.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not provide insight into why the move was incorrect or how it could have been avoided.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"
Black pieces have revived and have found new objects to attack.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it only describes the state of the game after the move, not the reason behind the mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 f6 7.

Threatening to double rooks on the file f and to breakthrough into the White's camp.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it only describes a potential strategy rather than addressing the specific error in the move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5.

"A ""French"" bishop, sleeping so far, intends to enter play with a decisive effect.",True,"

The comment indicates that the player made a tactical oversight by not considering the potential threat of the bishop, which was previously out of play but could have been a powerful attacker.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5.

"The time control had passed, there was the time to deepen in a position. As it seemed to me, I found the way to win.",True,"

The comment indicates that the player made a mistake by not using the available time to strategize and find a winning opportunity, which aligns with the idea that they missed a chance to improve their position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5.
