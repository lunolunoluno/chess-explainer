"this is a move-order finesse, taking advantage of White's 6. Nf3 instead of the standard h2-h4.

"a solid move that is very common (second choice in the database), just behind the more theoretical h2-h4.",True," The comment suggests the move is uninteresting and predictable, implying a lack of strategic depth.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

"in positions with a Black pawn on h6 (typically played as a response to h2-h4), it is essentially obligatory to exchange on d3. Here it is not, which is one of the main positional differences. Instead of helping develop White's queen with the exchange, the freeing pawn move is played. Incidentally, almost all of the top-level games in the database feature the text move.",True," The comment accurately identifies a positional flaw and suggests a strategic deviation, indicating a significant mistake.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

"another difference is that the bishop can be developed here rather than e7, preventing White's bishop from going to f4 and getting on the more active h2-b8 diagonal.",True," The comment suggests a potential tactical weakness and a strategic alternative, indicating a flawed move.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

"the most common plan here. The White bishop will get no better and exchanging itself for its counterpart on g6 allows the infliction of a minor weakness on the h-file for Black.

"this takes advantage of the doubled g-pawns, as White exchanging on f6 will no longer inflict positional damage.

"this is not a bad decision, but the follow-up is poor.

"not admitting the mistake with the knight, as it would be best to bring it back immediately.
