"That time I only knew about my opponent, that he was a very strong Russian player rated at 2690 elo points. He became the CC World Champion simuktaneously with our game. The text is a rather rare move, but not weak. Black aims his Queen at the squares b2 and d4. White either withdraws his Knight from d4, or he has to face tactical threats.",True,"
The comment explains that it was a rare but not weak move, indicating some level of understanding but also acknowledging the mistake was made.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6.

More and more popular move.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake, as it seems to be commenting on the popularity of a move rather than its quality or suitability in the specific game situation.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2,"This is a game between Umanskij, M. (as White) and Glatt, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e2"
"An active move, but it seems to be better to defend first the pawn b2, and to play Be3 thereafter.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by suggesting a more defensive approach to protect the pawn and develop the bishop, which could lead to a better position.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3,"This is a game between Umanskij, M. (as White) and Glatt, G. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3"
"When I played this move (at the end of 1993) I could not find any game with this position, but since that time it has turned up in some games. The present game and also the other ones prove, that Black can capture the pawn b2 safely. Although White gets Black's weak pawn on d6, but he can't defend his pawn on c4. White has some development and space advantage for his pawn, but Black's position is defensible.",False,"

The comment does not fully explain the mistake, as it only identifies the potential problems and strengths in both players' positions without providing an evaluation of the specific move played.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2,"This is a game between Umanskij, M. (as White) and Glatt, G. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on b2"
"# The world Champion plays much more stronger, and prepares a new sacrifice in order to start a huge attack.",True,"

This comment explains the mistake made by the player as it indicates a blunder from a world champion, suggesting that the move was unexpectedly weak and led to a significant attack opportunity for the opponent.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18.

Strike while the iron is hot!,False,"

The comment ""Strike while the iron is hot!"" is an idiomatic expression meaning to take advantage of a favorable opportunity, which does not directly explain why a chess move was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18.

"It was hard to decide, but I thought it was better for me to defend my position with a material advantage than to do so without it.",True,"

This comment indicates that the player had a strategic reason for their move, even though it was ultimately a mistake, demonstrating that the comment explains the mistake made by the player.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

"White has proceeded with his attack very well so far. His chain of pawns paralyses Black's King side, his minor pieces threaten with dangerous manoeuvres, while Black's Rooks are powerless for the moment. But White plays in too great hurry now. He should have played Nf3 or pushed his pawn to h4. These moves would have controlled the square g5 taking it away from Black's Queen and probably also forcing Black to capture the pawn on f5. Black prepares now a spectacular combination.",True,"

The comment does explain the mistake made by the player, suggesting that White should have played Nf3 or h4 to exert more pressure on Black's position and potentially force an advantageous exchange.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18.

Last move played: White plays Knight to f4"
"The most difficult move of the game. Black defends the point g7 in advance, and closes the diagonal a2-g8 at the same time.",False,"
The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it describes a defensive move by Black, rather than indicating a mistake by the player in question.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18.

"This move could have been played already instead of 26...Rf7, but it wouldn't have been as strong as now. After 26...Bf5 27.exf5 Nxf5 28.Ne4! Nxh6 29.Nxc5 Black has the better position, but to find a winning plan isn't simple at all.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it analyzes the repercussions of the move 26...Rf7 and suggests a better alternative, indicating that the player's move could have been played earlier but was less optimal.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4.

There is no better move!,True,"

The comment implies that the player made a poor decision that could have been easily avoided, indicating a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7.

The World Champion offered a draw here.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it refers to an offer of a draw that does not necessarily indicate a poor move.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18. Qh6 Nxc4 19. f4 Nd2 20. f5 Nxb1 21. Nxb1 Qc5+ 22.

Last move played: White plays Knight takes on g6"
"Although the power of the White pieces have been weakened, they have still serious threats, for example Ng3-f5.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential threat posed by the opponent's knight to the White's king's pawn on f3.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5.

"With his last move Black has thrown his Rooks on the files d and f into the fight, which decides the game.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it simply states that Black's rooks are now in the fight, without addressing why it was a mistake.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 c6 9. h3 exd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 11. Nde2 Nc5 12. Be3 Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. Qxd6 Nfd7 15. Bd4 Bxd4 16. Qxd4 Ne6 17. Qd2 Ne5 18.

The simplest: Black gives the quality back for another pawn.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made, as Black has lost a pawn for a temporary positional advantage.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Nbd7 7.
