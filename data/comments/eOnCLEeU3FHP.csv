D43: Semi-Slav: 5 Bg5 h6,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake, as Bg5 is an aggressive move that can lead to tactical complications in the Semi-Slav defense.",1. d4,"This is a game between Topalov, V. (as White) and Kramnik, V. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4"," '5. Bg5 h6': This move in the Semi-Slav Defense doesn't follow the principle of developing pieces to active squares.

Last move played: Black plays Knight to d3", Black's knight move to d3 is not aggressive enough.

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights a specific tactical threat (capturing the rook on e6) that could have arisen from the player's move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.
