"Everyone wants to play like a champion! Only one year has passed since the London-2000 battle between Kasparov and Kramnik, but the Berlin wall has acquired many admirers.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the mistake made by the player, but rather references a historical chess match between Kasparov and Kramnik, which does not provide insight into the error made in the current game.",1. e4 e5 2.

"This is a novelty, and maybe not good. As you have seen Kramnik never forgot to play h5 after h2-h3. It's very important to take care of the knight on f5.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it points out the lack of consideration for the knight on f5, which is a common strategic element in chess games.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

An interesting plan.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it merely describes the move as ""interesting"" without highlighting its error or suggesting an alternative strategy.",1. e4 e5 2.

Black weakens the d5-square. Maybe he can avoid this and play 14...h5!?,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player as it points out the weakening of a crucial square, offering a potential alternative move to avoid the issue.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

Black can't bear such a strong knight and has to part with his main plus - a pair of bishops.,False,"

The comment doesn't directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it focuses on potential future consequences rather than the immediate issue with the previous move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

"Obviously all of White's pieces are placed better than his opponent's, though it's hard to exploit this advantage because Black hasn't any pawn weaknesses.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses the relative positioning of the pieces rather than the specific move that led to a poor position.",1. e4 e5 2.

To interrupt Black's counter-play with b6-b5 etc. It's almost always useful to block your opponent's pawns on squares the same colour as his bishop.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests a strategic reason for blocking the opponent's pawns, which can be a valid defensive move in chess.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to c4", White's attempt to disrupt Black's plans with b6-b5 is generally not recommended. It's usually more advantageous to prevent your opponent's pawns on squares of the same color as their bishop.
Prophylaxy vs. Na5.,False,"

The comment ""Prophylaxy vs. Na5"" does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it seems to reference a broader strategic approach rather than a specific move error.",1. e4 e5 2.

It is Interesting that both players dream to part with their own bishop.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it only states that both players are trying to remove their own bishops, which is not informative about the specific error in the move.",1. e4 e5 2.

In reality White is a pawn up because on the queen side his two pawns on b3 and c4 cost no less than Black's three pawn. Also White has more space and now feels his way to the weak pawn on h7.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the material imbalance and spatial advantage White has over Black, which are critical factors in assessing the quality of a move.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: White plays Pawn to h5", White isn't pawn ahead because Black's pawns outnumber White's. White has more space but must be cautious of Black's weak h7 pawn.
Black's counter-play is too late.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it indicates that the player missed an opportunity for counter-play, implying a delay in responding to the opponent's strategy.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
