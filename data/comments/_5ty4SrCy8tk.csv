"[A reversed Benko. Personally I wouldn't dream of letting my opponent play such a critical variation with an extra tempo, but Bernard's play is nothing if not optimistic!]",False,"

The comment is more of an assessment of the opponent's willingness to take risks rather than an explanation of the mistake made by the player.",1.

"[Black makes the critical decision to allow the capture of the black-squared bishop. 11...Be7 would of course permit White to regain his pawn by 12.Bxc6+, but it would by no means clearly good to do so.]",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting that Black's move of 11...Be7 allowed White to capture the bishop with 12.Bxc6+, which would be a strategic advantage for White.",1.

"[15...Qxc4 16.d3 is awkward for Black. Now, my original intention was also 16.d3, but after rejecting that and 16.Rb1, I fortunately settled on a strong move.]",True,"

The comment explains that the player's intended move was 16.d3, but it was considered awkward for Black, indicating that they made a mistake by playing it.",1.

[Watch this pawn!],True,"

The comment ""[Watch this pawn!]"" implies that the player made a blunder by moving a pawn unnecessarily or in a way that led to a disadvantage, indicating the comment explains the mistake.",1.

Qb1 h5,"This is a game between Lennox, C J. (as White) and Milligan, B. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5", Black's move to h5 is a misstep. It exposes their king to potential threats and weakens their pawn structure.
"[Now I had nned 22.Bf5 Qh6 23.Bxc8 hxg3 24.Bd7+! bt when I noticed that Black could play 22...Qd5 instead, I looked for something better.]",False,"

The comment reflects a moment of realization but does not directly explain the mistake made by the player.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 d4 3. g3 c5 4. b4 cxb4 5. a3 e6 6. Bg2 Nc6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Bb2 bxa3 9.

[A better chance than either 26... h1Q 27.Rxh1 Rxh1 28.Qf8+ or 26...Qd8 27.Rxc8!],True,"

The comment accurately identifies a mistake made by the player by suggesting better alternative options that would have been more strategically sound.",1.

"[The h-pawn has done all that could be expected of it, but...]",True,"

The comment suggests that the h-pawn move was not a good decision, implying that it was a mistake.",1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 d4 3. g3 c5 4. b4 cxb4 5. a3 e6 6. Bg2 Nc6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Bb2 bxa3 9. Nxa3 Bc5 10.

[I don't recall ever capturing two queens in three moves before!],True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as capturing two queens in three moves is an extremely rare occurrence and likely a result of an oversight or a poorly executed strategy.",1.

[34...b5 35.Re7+ Kc6 36.Rd6# would be a fitting finish to the attack on the black squares!],True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move [34...b5] was a mistake as it allowed 35.Re7+, which was a strong tactical response leading to checkmate on the next move if Black didn't respond correctly.",1.
