"I had actually prepared 1.d4 for the tournament, but I backed out in every (!) game for various different reasons. In this case it was because things were in such a rut I would only be cheered by winning in crushing style. Thankfully it worked!",False,"

"He falls for it. On the one hand the refutation is not trivial, in fact I had some trouble remembering it. However, I was still very surprised as it is something one should know if they are going to play the Pelikan.",True,"

"Definitely the most resiliant. My memory did not serve here so we were both on our own, but I used the process of elimination to guide me through the next couple moves, knowing the resulting position should be winning for white.",False,"

I did see 19.Nxf1 but I decided to win more devastatingly by leaving the knight in play for a direct attack.,True,"
