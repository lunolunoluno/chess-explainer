A move that is very subjective. Personally I think the Bishop belongs on d6. 10/\Bd6 is much more aggressive since the Bishop has plans for the Kingside. Also the square f4 tends to be a key post for White in the Tarrasch.

"White's move is not bad. The idea is to attempt an ""instant"" endgame where White's pawn structure is superior. Also it stops /\Qd6 which is a natural freeing move and gives you plenty of opportunity to lose material. You avoid these pitfalls. A stronger consideration in this position would be the move 14/\Bxf3. After 15. Qxf3 Ne5 Qf5 16. Nxd3 17.cxd3 the possibility of 17/\Rd2 comes close to working. 18. Nd4 Bxd4 19. Qxd4 Qd6. The question is which will be stronger, the Bishop or the Knight. In the endgame with pawns on both sides, the Bishop is favored.

"Sweet! This subtle idea invokes many possibilities. Take some time to ponder this point. Ouch again. Try 24/ \Rb6. The Knight without a target is only taking up space. I know the proverbial idea of taking away the Knight's advance points but in this case it opens the door for White to gain a comfortable position. When you have positional justification - ATTACK! The move /\g6 can be played later. The idea is to inspire those Queenside pawns to move and weaken themselves before your opponent can fix the a-pawn and pick it off. Rad1 O.K. Your GM returns the favor. 25. Rae1 grabs space and almost wins the endgame by force. You might benefit by the study of isolated pawn play. The isolated pawn is safely blocked. Controlling the e-file would cut off the support of the King. The fatal attack on the blocked pawn must come either from behind or beside the pawn. This can't be achieved with the Rook on d1. It's unbelievable that a GM would miss this move. You get time to set up an adequate defense. Nice! This is about the only chance you have to protect your weakness. White should now shift the attention to immobilizing the a-pawn and finding a way to pile up against it. The very real problem is going to be that Black gets to stack the Rooks.
