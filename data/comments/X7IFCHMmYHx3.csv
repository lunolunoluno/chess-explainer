"A draw was enough for Karpov to win the match, which is possibly why he did not play his usual starting move. Mischa Tal also used to open like this when he was in a peaceful frame of mind.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses draw conditions and personal habits of other players without addressing the specific error in the move.",1. Nf3,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"
"Speelman's move, popular for a while but now out of fashion.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the mistake made by the player but rather comments on the overall popularity of the move.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to a3"
"Originally an idea of Hort's, found during preparations for my semi-final match against Speelman in 1989. Later, Sax played it a few times in his match against Kortchnoi, Wijk aan Zee 1991. Black prepares the development of his bishops to b7 and c5, hoping to prove that White's sixth move is a slight weakness.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it highlights the potential weakness in White's sixth move and the player's intention to exploit it by developing their bishops to b7 and c5.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to b6"
"This is what Kortchnoi played in his first game against Sax. In a later game he tried 8.Qf4 in order to follow up with the push 9.e4. Karpov probably didn't know too much about these games, as he used a lot of time and failed to come up with a convincing new idea.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player; it refers to Kortchnoi's strategies in games against Sax and Karpov without addressing the specific move in question.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4"
"So far, we have followed - with some minor transpositions - the first match game of Kortchnoi-Sax. (It is remarkable that both Kortchnoi and Karpov, during their first confrontation with this system, opted for the same set-up.) In that game Black played 13...Ba6 in order to provoke 14.b3, after which, he returned to base with 14...Bb7, with the intention of hindering the development of the White king's bishop. { After a long think, I decided on a different approach.",True,"

The comment provides a detailed analysis of the move played and explains the strategic reasoning behind it, suggesting that the move was intentional and thoughtful, despite the player's decision to choose a different approach.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e3"
"A useful waiting move. Black is waiting for the weakening f2-f3, after which he will take his bishop to a6 and exert maximum pressure against the White c-pawn. { In Inside Chess, Seirawan indicates 13...Rc6 as even better, with the variation 14.Qd4 Qa8 15.Be2 Rc5 16.f3 d5, with advantage for Black. Difficult as I find it to contradict the analysis of one of my seconds, I don't think this recommendation is very sound. 15.Bd3 is much better for White, who can then meet 15...Rc5 with 16.e4, which leaves the Black queen rather stranded on a8.",True,"

The comment explains the player's mistake by providing alternative moves that could have been made, suggesting the mistake in the initial move and offering better options for the player.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to e8"
"Less effective was 14...Ba6, as this enables White to reply 15.b3 Rc6 16.Qc6.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies 14...Ba6 as a mistake because it allows White to respond with 15.b3 and 16.Qc6, gaining a tempo and advantageous position.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c6"
"White is aiming for simplification, but he is in fact helping Black. Correct was 16.Na2!, relieving the pressure on c4. After 16...Rc5 17.Nb4 Bb7 Black has a comfortable game, but no more.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as 16.Na2 was not a strong move and 16.Nb4 would have been a better alternative to relieve pressure on c4.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e4"
"An interesting alternative was the immediate push 17...d5, with the point 18.cxd5 exd5 19.Rxd5 Qa8!, and White is in dire trouble. Accepting the pawn offer is irresponsible. White would do better to continue with 19.Qd4 (instead of 19.Rxd5) 19...Bxf1 20.Rxf1. Black can still then try to use his major pieces to wrestle the initiative from his opponent during the middlegame, but there is little hope of a large advantage. With a natural text-move Black intends to provoke the slightly weakening b2-b3 before going for the breaking move d7-d5.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, highlighting a missed opportunity to gain a slight advantage and the consequences of the chosen move.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c7"
"More accurate was 18.b3, after which Black's best move is the preventative 18...g6. White can then develop his bishop to e2, where it is safer, as we will soon see. After the text, Black's advantage probably takes on decisive proportions.",True,"

The comment provides a clear analysis of the mistake, suggesting that the move 18.b3 could have been more accurate, and then explains the better response for Black followed by White's safer development options.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18. Bd3,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to d3"
"The alternative 19.0-0, with the point 19...Bxc4 20.Bxc4 Rxc4 21.Rxd7, wasn't attractive either, as Black then takes control of both open files with 21...Qxd7 (not 21...Rxe4 22.Rxc7 Rxe3 23.Rd1!, with sufficient counterplay) 22.Qc4 Rc8. A possible continuation is 23.Qe2 Qa4 24.Rd1 Rc2, and now: A) 25.Rd2 Rc1+ 26.Kf2 Qh4+, and wins. B) 25.Rd8+ Kg7 26.Qd1. The most stubborn defense. In case of 26...Qc4 White has to accept a rook ending a pawn down with 27.Qd4+, which should be technically winning for Black, especially in view of the weakened White kingside pawn structure caused by the advance of the f-pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting the potential for Black to gain control over the open files and creating a winning position for Black, and also mentions the weakened White kingside pawn structure.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18. Bd3 g6 19. b3,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3"
"Now this advance is strongest, with move 13 turning out to be unexpectedly useful.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it states that the move was unexpectedly useful, suggesting it was a good move rather than a mistake.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18. Bd3 g6 19. b3 d5,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5"
"A painful decision, but castling wouldn't have been very good for White either. After 22.0-0 Rc3 23.Qxd5 Rexe3 the Black rooks reign supreme. This shows very clearly what a weakening move the advance of the b-pawn really was.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake by highlighting the weakening effect of the b-pawn advance, which made castling a less favorable option for White, and emphasizes the resulting dominance of Black's rooks after White's move.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

"In these circumstances, Black takes with the other rook, as 23...Rexe3 would not be very effective after 24.Rhe1.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by Black, suggesting that taking with the other rook (23...Rxe3) would not be effective after White's response of 24.Rhe1, indicating a potential blunder.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

White is trying to stay on his feet in the middlegame by deploying his major pieces. After 24.Rhe1 Rxe1 25.Rxe1 Rxe1 26.Kxe1 Qxh2 Black would liquidate into a winning queen ending.,True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake by highlighting that White's move, 24.Rhe1, allows Black to activate the queen with 24...Rxe1, which can lead to a winning queen ending due to the lack of defensive resources for White.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

"24...Qf4 was also strong, but the text is more effective. The main threat is 25...Re1, forcing White to give up one of his queenside pawns.",True,"

The comment provides an explanation for the mistake by highlighting the potential threat of 25...Re1 that forces White to give up a pawn.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18. Bd3 g6 19. b3 d5 20. cxd5 Bxd3 21.

"Desperation. White hopes to take his king to safety after 25...Qxa3 by playing 26.Rb1, followed by 27.h3, the idea being that with all major pieces around, Black would not be able to go for the final position which is a clear technical win. But Black has a stronger capture up his sleeve.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player as a desperate attempt to save the king, suggesting that the player's plan could backfire due to Black's better options.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

Last move played: White plays King to g3"
"This wins a pawn, while keeping a strong initiative going. 26.Qxb3 would run into the devastating 26...Qg5+.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player as it discusses the potential consequences of the move and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong initiative.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on b3"
Forcing White into total passivity.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by indicating that the move put White in a position where they had no active options, effectively rendering them a passive player.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

Kh3 Re2,"This is a game between Karpov, An (as White) and Timman, J (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to e2"
"After repeating moves, Black chases the enemy queen from her dominant position. The end is near.",True,"

The comment accurately describes a common mistake where Black repeatedly moves without improving their position or defending their pieces, allowing White to gain an advantage and potentially win the game.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

More subtle than the obvious 34...h5. Black keeps the h5 square for a possible queen check. Now White is more or less in Zugzwang.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the missed opportunity for a more sophisticated plan with 34...h5, and the resulting Zugzwang situation for White.",1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. a3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 b6 8. Bf4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Rd1 Bb7 11. Bd6 Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Rc8 13. e3 Re8 14. f3 Rc6 15. Qd4 Ba6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Qc7 18.

With devastating threat of 38...Rd4. Now White commits hara-kiri.,True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the significant 3-move checkmate threat (zugzwang), and suggests that White has no viable moves left.",1.
