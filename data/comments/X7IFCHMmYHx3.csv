"This is what Kortchnoi played in his first game against Sax. In a later game he tried 8.Qf4 in order to follow up with the push 9.e4.

"So far, we have followed - with some minor transpositions - the first match game of Kortchnoi-Sax.

Difficult as I find it to contradict the analysis of one of my seconds, I don't think this recommendation is very sound. 15.Bd3 is much better for White, who can then meet 15...Rc5 with 16.e4, which leaves the Black queen rather stranded on a8.",True," The comment offers a potential alternative move and a rationale for why the initial move was considered a mistake, suggesting a more effective strategy.",1.
