"This sharp advance repeatedly occurs in similar positions in the Sicilian. In this case, however, it is premature. The attack has point when it leads to the opening of a file by Pg5 (eg. Black has played ... Ph6 and White has castled on the other side) or when it succeeds in driving back the enemy pieces. Even in such cases it needs very careful preparation, for the advance Pg4-g5 is bound to create weaknesses in one's own camp. A sudden counterattack may prove devastating, and in practise this is quite frequently what happens",True," The comment identifies a recurring pattern of aggressive play leading to weaknesses, suggesting a flawed strategic assessment.",1. e4 c5 2.
