The comment accurately explains the mistake as it suggests that the move Pe4 was vulnerable to an attack with...Nc6-a5xb3, and it offers a strategic alternative for White by recommending the maneuver Nb1-d2-f1-g3.",1. e4 e5 2.

"This might be considered a downside of 10. Na3 since it stops White's plan, or it might be considered a positional gain since Black is giving a bishop for the knight. Such exchanges can be difficult to evaluate.",True,"

Amazingly this gives White a very good chance to turn the tables. Ng2 and Re1 remain en prise while White begins to attack at Pf7 and/or Ph7. White turns the question of whether White's king is exposed into one of which side's queen can participate in an attack best: and the answer to that question is White!,False,"
