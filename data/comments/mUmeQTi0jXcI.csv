"Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's answer to the Queen's Gambit. Once again today, Fritz chooses an opening line which allows for piece activity.",True," Yes, the comment identifies a potential weakness in Tarrasch's opening choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

The legendary Akiba Rubinstein found this most effective move against the Tarrasch Defence in the early 20th century. The fianchettoed bishop is to exploit the potentially-isolated d5-pawn.,True," The comment offers a historical reference, potentially providing insight into why the move was considered a mistake, though it doesn't directly explain the flaw.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

"All theory. With this pawn break, White contests Black's center pawns, aiming to open lines for his two bishops and perhaps an exchange of queens.",True," The comment suggests a flawed plan based on theory, indicating a significant strategic error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

"This has all been play with which Kramnik is apparently familiar. Up to this point, he's used up very little time. White has a nice advantage here. His rook is sole commander of the d-file, and his laser-beam bishops penetrate the heart of Black's queenside. The only disadvantage (other than those loose queenside pawns) is that this is exactly the kind of open position in which Fritz has little trouble finding the best moves.",True," The comment offers a specific analysis of the position, suggesting Kramnik's limited use of the move and highlighting Fritz's potential advantage, which could be a valid critique of the mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

"Kramnik spent 31 minutes before committing to this move. The c3-pawn would have been too much of a burden to protect. In any case, with his rook on the seventh, White looks forward to regaining his pawn.",True," The comment offers a potential tactical explanation for the mistake, suggesting a defensive choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

Fritz gladly gives up a pawn to exchange bishops. The machine here sees that the resulting position is a draw.,True," The comment describes a potential draw, suggesting the player's move led to a resignation rather than a decisive advantage.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.

"At this point, with his king confined to the first rank, White hasn't the slightest hope for a win. The extra rook pawn means little, as it is under easy surveilance by Black's active rook. Of course, Kramnik has to play on for another 14 moves, just in case...",True," The comment suggests the move was a mistake due to the opponent's rook and the lack of a clear attack, indicating a flawed assessment of the position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.
