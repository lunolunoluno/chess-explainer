"There's no pin on Nc3, but he might remove it to prevent White from keeping control of d5",True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it identifies the potential weakness on d5 that can be exploited if the knight is taken away, as indicated by the move Nc3.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to b4"
White would rather trade for Nf6 and leave Bb4 to look for something to do.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic mistake made by White, as trading for knight moves into the central square (Nf6) would allow Black to potentially activate their bishop (Bb4) and create threats in the center or on the queen's side.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d5"
"White takes away d4 and will also probably play a2-a3, b2-b4 to chase Bc5 and Nc6. The cost is that it blocks in Bc1 for a time. It also prepares to meet ...Nf6xd5.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it discusses potential subsequent moves rather than the specific error in the player's previous move.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e3"
"This isn't to play ...b7-b5, as that would weaken Nc6 far too much. Instead, it gives Bc5 room to retreat.",True,"

The comment correctly points out that moving the bishop to b5 weakens the knight on c6, which is a valid explanation for why the move may be considered a mistake.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"
Since Black has spent a tempo on ...a7-a6 White decides to play Bc1-b2 and d2-d4. This seems perfectly reasonable.,True,"

The comment correctly identifies that White's decision to play Bc1-b2 and d2-d4 after Black's...a7-a6 move is reasonable, as it helps White to control the center and develop pieces.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to b3"
I don't quite know why he'd allow Black's queen to come out so easily. Leaving Nf6 kept Qd8 blocked.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights the vulnerability created by the move Nf6, which allowed the Black queen to come out and threaten the White king with Qd8.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on f6 with check"
threat ...e5-e4 with a two-fold attack on Ra1 and Nf3,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as the mentioned moves (e5-e4 with a two-fold attack on Ra1 and Nf3) are not feasible or relevant to the current position.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen takes on f6"
"This pin is important and has to be broken with h2-h3. The immediate threat is NOT ...e5-e4 because Bb2 still pins Pe5 to Qf6. But, Black might play ...Qf6-e6 to prepare ...e5-e4 and/or ...Bg4-h3xg2.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the critical mistake of not breaking the pin on the knight with h2-h3 and also highlights the potential threats that Black could pose with moves like...Qf6-e6 and...Bg4-h3xg2.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g4"
"This position doesn't offer many possibilities for White to win, but Ba7 and Nc6 are blocked, so Black doesn't have much either.",True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, indicating a lack of significant strategic options for both sides in the current position.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3 Qe7 14. Qd2,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to d2"
White is feeling squeezed and uses this tactic to force f2-f4 or another simplification.,True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the player's move has created an opportunity for the opponent to simplify the position, likely putting White at a disadvantage.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3 Qe7 14. Qd2 f5 15. Rae1 Rae8 16. Bc3 Kh8 17. Nh4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to h4"
preventing f2-f4 for the moment,True,"

The comment ""preventing f2-f4 for the moment"" acknowledges the player's intention to hinder the opponent from advancing their pawn to f4, showing an understanding of the strategic concern behind the mistake and the potential threat of the pawn move.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3 Qe7 14. Qd2 f5 15. Rae1 Rae8 16. Bc3 Kh8 17. Nh4 Qg5,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to g5"
"After this White is more free to play d3-d4, completely shutting out Ba7. However, king safety comes first, so he forces simplification.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the consequence of the move, emphasizing the importance of king safety over other strategic considerations.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3 Qe7 14. Qd2 f5 15. Rae1 Rae8 16. Bc3 Kh8 17. Nh4 Qg5 18. Kh2 f4 19. exf4 exf4,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on f4"
"What's the bishop doing on e8? I don't think he wanted to risk an endgame a pawn down, even if he had compensation.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made, highlighting the potential risk of an endgame with a pawn down and the possibility of compensation.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 Bc5 6. Bg2 d6 7. O-O O-O 8. e3 a6 9. b3 Ba7 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3 Qe7 14. Qd2 f5 15. Rae1 Rae8 16. Bc3 Kh8 17. Nh4 Qg5 18. Kh2 f4 19. exf4 exf4 20. Rxe8 Bxe8,"This is a game between Vallejo Pons, Francisco (as White) and Anand, Viswanathan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop takes on e8"
"It seems to me Anand played terrific up to a point and then became gun-shy. So, Vallejo Pons continues racking up the draws.",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player; it rather provides an opinion on the player's mentality and the opponent's performance.",1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5.
