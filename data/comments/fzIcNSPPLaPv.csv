Before Steinitz there was a belief that the only way to fight for advantage was to keep the pawn structure in the centre intact:,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player but rather provides historical context about chess strategy.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4",-
"Here it is! With this move White begins to maintain a stronghold on d4. Nowadays we prefer to refrain from the immediate exchange on c5, starting with",False,"

This was unnecessary. I would consider,True,"

The comment implies the move was extra and not essential to the game's outcome, suggesting the player made a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to a6"," ""This move was unnecessary as it does not align with the strategic goals of Black."""
This move defines Black's plan a bit prematurely. 9...b5 was more appropriate.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, suggesting that a different move would have been more strategic in terms of Black's plan.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to b4", 'Playing Knight to b4 by Black too early may not align with their strategy. 9...b5 would have been a better choice.'
It's always strange for me to give an exclamation mark to a move that any professional player today would make automatically. But in 1885 it wasn't that easy to foresee all the consequences of this decision.,True,"

This comment justifies the move by acknowledging the historical context and suggesting that the complexity of foreseeing all the consequences in 1885 was a significant challenge for players at that time.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn takes on d3"," White's move to take on d3 seems risky. Even back in 1885, professionals would consider the potential dangers of such a move. It's crucial to anticipate the consequences before making a decision like this."
"12...b4! was a must in this position, stopping White's plan, conquering space on the queenside and preparing a proper development of the light-squared bishop after a6-a5 and Ba6.",True,"

The comment is correct in criticizing the move 12...b4 as a mistake because it indeed fails to stop White's plan, does not conquer enough space on the queenside, and does not effectively prepare the development of the light-squared bishop after the suggested pawn moves.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to b6", The move 12...b4! by the player was a significant error. It disrupted White's positional plan and wasted time on the queenside. Black failed to improve their position and didn't properly develop their bishop after preparing the pawn break with a6-a5 and Ba6.
The decisive mistake - Black himself kills any potential of counterplay with this move. Worthy of attention was,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake, indicating that the player's move eliminated any potential for counterplay, which is a critical insight for understanding the implications of the move in the overall game.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

(as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"," Steinitz, W. (White) made a critical error by playing Pawn to f5. This move eliminates any chance of counterplay from Black."
"# Steinitz has set up a powerful dream-knight on d4, which is opposed by a miserable bishop on b7. Now Black can only wait for the immanent execution.",True,"

The comment accurately describes a tactical motif in chess, where a knight on d4 is potentially threatening an undefended or weak bishop on b7, suggesting a significant tactical opportunity for the player who made the move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4,"This is a game between Steinitz, W. (as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to d4"," White's knight move to d4 puts pressure on Black's position, but it might be too aggressive without sufficient support. Black must remain cautious and look for opportunities to counter White's initiative."
"preventing g2-g4, which could be unpleasant with the king on f7. But the game is being decided on the other flank, although later White will benefit from the weakness of g5 and the diagonal h4-d8. Never push your pawns without real necessity - one of Steinitz'centralrules!",True,"

The comment accurately explains that the move likely opened lines for the opponent's pieces and weakened the player's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7.

(as White) and Zelman (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to h5"," 'Black's h5 move isn't needed, as it doesn't contribute to the game's strategy. Without real necessity, pushing pawns can be detrimental, as seen with White's potential weakness in g5 and the diagonal connecting h4 to d8. Steinitz's central rule about cautious pawn play is a reminder to avoid such unnecessary advances.'"
White inexorably tightens the noose around Black's neck.,False,"

The comment uses metaphorical language and does not provide a clear explanation of the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8.

"# For a moment Black defends his main weaknesses, but White can bring one more piece into action.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by the player as a temporary defense of the main weaknesses, indicating that there's an opportunity for White to capitalize on the situation.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 Be7 14. a3 f5 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 19. Nc3 Kf7 20.

Threatens Bh4. Now Black's defence resources are exhausted.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it refers to a move (Bh4) that doesn't exist in standard chess notation, making the explanation unclear and incorrect.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

What a strategical triumph!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it suggests the opposite, portraying the move as a strategic success rather than a blunder.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.
