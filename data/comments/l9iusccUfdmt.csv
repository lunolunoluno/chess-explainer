(5. a3? Qf6 -+ typical Marshall trap.),True,"

The comment correctly identifies that the move 5. a3 was a mistake, as it opens the b2 square which can lead to the Marshall trap, where Black can effectively counterattack.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Ne4 4. Nfd2 Bb4 5. Qc2,"This is a game between Alekhine (as White) and Marshall, F.J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to c2"," The move 5. a3 is not advisable as it overlooks Black's typical response of 5...Qe7, which aims to safeguard the king and prepare for potential central counter-play."
White was threatening 10. a3 Bd6 11. Bxd6 Qxd6 12. cd5 ed5 13. Nxd5!,True,"

The comment effectively explains the mistake made by White, as it outlines a clear series of moves leading to a significant loss of material without any apparent compensation.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Ne4 4. Nfd2 Bb4 5. Qc2 d5 6. Nc3 f5 7. Ndxe4 fxe4 8. Bf4 O-O 9. e3 c6,"This is a game between Alekhine (as White) and Marshall, F.J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c6"," White's strategy was flawed with their move 10. a3. Black's response was strong, capturing the bishop with 10...Bd6. White's decision to trade the bishop for the knight on d5 with 11. Bxd6 was regrettable, leading to a disadvantageous queen move 11...Qxd6. White's position weakened further when they advanced their pawn to c5 with 12. cd5, which was met with 12...ed5. The knight's capture on d5 by White's knight 13. Nxd5 was a poor choice, leaving White at a disadvantage."
There is hardly anything better for Black.,True,"

The comment likely refers to the move having a detrimental impact on the player's position, leading to a significant strategic disadvantage or loss of material.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Ne4 4. Nfd2 Bb4 5. Qc2 d5 6. Nc3 f5 7. Ndxe4 fxe4 8. Bf4 O-O 9. e3 c6 10. Be2 Nd7 11. a3 Be7 12. O-O Bg5,"This is a game between Alekhine (as White) and Marshall, F.J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to g5"," ""Black's last move to g5 is not ideal."""
(16....dxc4 17. Bxc4 Nb6 18. Qf2! + =),True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the pawn capture 16...dxc4, which is a common blunder, and points out the subsequent moves that follow the blunder.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Ne4 4. Nfd2 Bb4 5. Qc2 d5 6. Nc3 f5 7. Ndxe4 fxe4 8. Bf4 O-O 9. e3 c6 10. Be2 Nd7 11. a3 Be7 12. O-O Bg5 13. f3 Bxf4 14. exf4 Rxf4 15. fxe4 Rxf1+ 16. Rxf1 e5,"This is a game between Alekhine (as White) and Marshall, F.J. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e5"," '(16....e5 dxc4 17. Bxc4 Nb6 18. Qf2!?) This move by White is considered suboptimal as it neglects the development of other pieces, particularly the knight and the bishop, and does not address the central pawn that Black has just advanced, creating imbalances that could be exploited by Black.'"
Not 23. e6 Nf6 24 e5 Nh7!,True,"

The comment identifies a mistake in the move sequence, indicating a potential error in the player's strategy.",1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Ne4 4. Nfd2 Bb4 5. Qc2 d5 6. Nc3 f5 7. Ndxe4 fxe4 8.

Bh5,"This is a game between Alekhine (as White) and Marshall, F.J. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to h5"," Black continues with the move 23... Nf6, which was not strong. The White bishop to h5 (22. Bh5) was poorly placed, as it's pinned to the White king and can be easily trapped."
