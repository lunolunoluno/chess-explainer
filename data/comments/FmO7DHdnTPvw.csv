"A Shirov, Anti-Marshall speciality.",True,"
The comment suggests that the player made a mistake by playing a move that is typically part of Shirov's Anti-Marshall strategy, indicating a poor move choice.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. h3,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Leko, P. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to h3"," White's Pawn to h3 is a strategic misstep by Shirov, potentially weakening their position. It's not aligned with Shirov's known Anti-Marshall strategies and risks creating unnecessary weaknesses."
"Up to now, 10 ..Re8 or ..d6 has been the only moves here. However, Leko's move fits in with his Archangel\Moeller set-up with ..Bb7.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it highlights that there are limited options for the opponent, and the move chosen by Leko fits his usual strategies, indicating that it may not be the best choice in this situation.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. h3 Bb7 9. d3 h6 10. Nc3 Bc5,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Leko, P. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to c5"," ""White should avoid both 10.Re8 and 10.d6, as they're not fitting Leko's Archangel/Moeller structure, which usually involves Bb7."""
"Common sense, really. Leko has to do something about the knight on a5, and his move (challenging the Shirov's strong, white-squared bishop) makes way for the knight to come back into the game via b7 or c6.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies Leko's lack of a concrete plan for the knight on a5, which could potentially become a strong piece, and suggests a better alternative to reintroduce the knight into play.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. h3 Bb7 9. d3 h6 10. Nc3 Bc5 11. a4 b4 12. Ne2 Na5 13. Ba2 d5 14. Nxe5 dxe4 15. d4 Ba7 16. Be3 Bd5,"This is a game between Shirov, A. (as White) and Leko, P. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to d5"," Leko's decision to move the bishop to d5 was poor. It allowed Shirov's knight on a5 to re-enter the game, potentially threatening White's position by coming to b7 or c6."
It's Planet Shirov time!,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, but rather humorously refers to former Grandmaster Anatoly Karpov's nickname ""Shirov Planet,"" which alludes to his dominance in the 1980s.",1. e4 e5 2.

Shirov still has some trick's left before the draw.,False,"

This comment does not explain the mistake made by the player. It seems to be addressing the remaining options for winning the game rather than addressing the specific move that was evaluated as a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6.

Nothing boring about this draw!,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it focuses on the outcome (draw) rather than the error in the move itself.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7.

And we all sat back getting ready for the final repetition...or so we thought.,True,"

The comment likely refers to a mistake made by the player that led to a repetitive position, indicating that the player repeated a move leading to a potential draw.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

"They have a saying in Spain: ""Tirar la casa la por ventana."" (Throwing the house out of the window). Fortunately for Shirov, Leko throws the house back through the window!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it uses an idiomatic expression to describe a costly blunder in the game.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7.
