"Nowadays a normal chessplayer playing with White would think about the possible continuation 19.Be4 or 19.Qf4 but the romatic attitude, typical at that time, demanded a more spectacular continuation. Then...",True,"

White has mate in his hands. Any Black's move which doesn't imply a serius threat for the King can cost the game.,True,"
