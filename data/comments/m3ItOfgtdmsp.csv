Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7,"This is a game between Reshevsky (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to d7"
"!? An attempt to improve on Golombek - Smyslov, Budapest 1952, which saw 9...a5.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake by referencing a known game between two grandmasters where a similar move (9...a5) was made, indicating that this move might not have been the best choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6,"This is a game between Reshevsky (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to c6"
This move has the goal of blasting open the center. After the king moves to the h-file Black can advance both e- and f-pawns.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it actually describes a potential strategy for Black after the king moves to the h-file, rather than evaluating the mistake.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8,"This is a game between Reshevsky (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black).

"?! Gligoric improved against me a week or two later with 13. Ne4!, with the threat of Nc5. Serves me right for getting the game published in the New York Times!",False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it criticizes the player's decision to publish the game in the New York Times rather than providing a chess-related explanation for the error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8 13. Nb5,"This is a game between Reshevsky (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to b5"
"It is clear that the Nc6 is headed for e5, with the possibility of jumping into f3. If only the g-file were open and a rook stood on g8...",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the mistake made by the player and suggests a better strategic move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9.

Last move played: White plays Queen to f4"
The pin looks strong - but checks have been known to break pins!,True,"
The comment explains the mistake as it implies that despite the pin appearing solid, the player's check revealed a flaw in the pinning strategy.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8 13. Nb5 Rc8 14. Bd2 a6 15. Na3 Kh8 16. Rac1 e5 17. d5 e4 18. Qf4 g5 19. Qxg5 Ne5 20.

!!,False,"

The comment ""!!"" does not clearly explain the mistake made by the player; it lacks specific details about the error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8.

"Black continues to make threats while improving the position of his queen, before capturing the pawn at b2.",True,"
The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, as capturing the pawn at b2 without addressing the threats from the opponent's pieces is a poor strategic choice.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8 13. Nb5 Rc8 14. Bd2 a6 15. Na3 Kh8 16. Rac1 e5 17. d5 e4 18. Qf4 g5 19. Qxg5 Ne5 20.

Desperately chasing checkmate.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the player's mistake by suggesting they are making a risky move in an attempt to achieve checkmate.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7.

White could have resigned here.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it does not provide any specific details about what the mistake was or why resigning was not the best option.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8 13. Nb5 Rc8 14. Bd2 a6 15. Na3 Kh8 16. Rac1 e5 17. d5 e4 18. Qf4 g5 19. Qxg5 Ne5 20.

Last move played: Black plays Rook takes on g4"
"Reshevsky finally resigned, since I'm going to sac the rook for the knight and grab the e-pawn, with a three pawn advantage.",True,"

The comment suggests that the player's opponent intentionally made a mistake by trading a rook for a knight and an e-pawn, resulting in a material advantage which likely led to resignation.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 g6 5. Bxc4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nfd7 8. Qe2 Nb6 9. Bb3 Nc6 10. Rd1 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe8 13. Nb5 Rc8 14. Bd2 a6 15. Na3 Kh8 16. Rac1 e5 17. d5 e4 18. Qf4 g5 19. Qxg5 Ne5 20.
