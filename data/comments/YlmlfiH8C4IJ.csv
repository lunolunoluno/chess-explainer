First played (I believe) by Andrei Kharltonov in the late 80s, the line soon became popular with some of the world's top Caro aficionados: Speelman, Anand and, of course, Karpov.",False,"

The comment explains the popularity and origin of the move but does not directly address the mistake made by the player in the specific move.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5 Ngf6 6.

"Black has to unravel somehow, and this is the best way.",False,"

The comment does not accurately explain the mistake made by the player, as it only suggests there is a solution without specifying what the mistake was or how the move leads to it.",1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.
