"Garry decided to play this much more passive move compared to 1.e4 or 1.d4, in an attempt to keep the game quiet, with as few tactical strikes as possible. As everybody knows, the computer's main strength lies in calculating concrete lines very fast and very far, and not necessarily in the area of positional play, so it is normal for Garry to try to steer the game in this direction.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting the move is overly passive and doesn't utilize strategic possibilities.",1.

"The computer passes on an attractive opportunity to double white's pawns on the 'f' file, by taking the knight on f3. This only means that in Deep Blue's eyes, keeping the pair of bishops is more important than ruining the opponent's pawn structure.

"Black's hesitation in the last moves allows white to grab the initiative. Nh4 is also a way of proving that black's overprotective h7-h6 a few moves back was no such a good idea. Now white threatens to push g3-g4, and send the bishop to g6, where the knight can't wait to capture it.

"If black doesn't want to lose this game quickly, he has to close the position. The push of the 'g' pawn created a very weak a1-h8 diagonal, which black has to cover in some way. e6-e5 is not without problems, as we'll see in a second, but Deep Blue has no other choice - the bishop on b2 is too powerful and its line of fire comes a little too close to the black king.",True," The comment identifies a specific strategic blunder and suggests a defensive response, indicating a flawed evaluation of the position.",1.

"Deep Blue discovered that one of the steps in white's march to f5 is the removal of the rook on f1. This means that the pawn on f2 suddenly loses its most defenders, so the machine, like a bloodhound, started the hunt.

"Both sides have achieved their ideal positions. Black's pieces are placed almost perfectly, but he still has the weak f5 square. White meanwhile is a little behind in development, but the same f5 square compensates for it plentifully. The only thing he does need to solve is the 'f2' problem. It is hard to play Nf5 while the black bishop and queen are enjoying such an impressive supremacy on the g1-a7 diagonal, but no one can stop white from slowly preparing b3-b4, for instance, and chasing the black bishop away, thus getting ready for the heralded arrival of the knight to f5.",True," The comment offers a detailed analysis of the mistake, highlighting a specific tactical weakness and suggesting a potential plan to address it.",1.

"This move obviously sacrifices an exchange, but it does two very significant things: it keeps the 'e' file tightly closed, thus making the black extra rook sit as a spectator for a while, and it gets rid of the black bishop.
