"This position can be reached from many move orders, including 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c6 4.g3 f5 5.Bg2 Nf6 6. 0-0 Bd6 7.Nbd2.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it outlines a specific sequence of moves leading to the given position, suggesting that the player could have reached a better position through alternative moves.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"
"Black usually plays ...Nbd7, to prevent White from occupying e5 with a knght.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake made by Black, as...Nbd7 is a more common and strategic move to prevent White's knight from occupying the e5 square.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to e7"
"White needs to occuly the e5 square at some point, since otherwise Black will eventually play ...e5. As long as White maintains control of e5, Black will find it difficult to activate the light-squared bishop.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies that White needs to maintain control of the e5 square to limit Black's piece activity, especially the light-squared bishop.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e5"
This is a standard anti-Dutch plan. The knight at e5 is supported by both a pawn at d4 and another knight at either f3 or d3.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it simply describes a common opening strategy without addressing any specific move or error.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3"
"Black can safely keep the knight here if an enemy knight is at f3, so that White cannot place a pawn there. In many cases the knight can sit at e4 even if the f3-square is not occupied, since the weakening of the a7-g1 diagonal can prove embarassing for White if the f-pawn advances. In addition, g3 can become vulnerable.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the strategic weaknesses in White's position and provides alternative placements for the knight, indicating that keeping it on e4 could be risky.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4"
White invites Black to advance the g-pawn. This is a double-edged strategy.,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake of White inviting Black to advance the g-pawn, which can lead to both White and Black gaining a pawn advantage.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to f4"
!? Black accepts the challenge.,True,"

The comment correctly interprets the move as a mistake because it suggests that the player intentionally or recklessly accepted a disadvantageous position.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g5"
"White now owns a superior bishop, but Black has plenty of room to maneuver.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the advantage gained by one player's move and acknowledges the counter-advantage or potential of the opponent.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight takes on d6"
"There are two ways to activate the light-squared bishop in the Stonewall Dutch. Black can fianchetto it at b7 under some circumstances, msot easily when the knight sits at b8 to defend the pawn at c6. The other plan, seen here, is to redeploy it on the kingside.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by suggesting an alternative plan for activating the bishop that the player did not consider.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e8"
White takes care to get the king off the a7-g1 diagonal in case Black opens up the game with ...c5.,False,"

The comment does not address the mistake made by the player; it refers to a potential future opening rather than analyzing the current move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8 15. f4 Bh5 16. Rac1 Rac8 17. Kh1,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays King to h1"
"Although Black has a bad bishop, there is little to fear in most of the possible endgames.",False,"

The comment does not explain the move as it does not address the quality or consequences of the move itself.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9.

White must now take seriously the threat of advancing the f-pawn.,True,"
The comment accurately explains that the player made a mistake by neglecting the potential danger of moving the f-pawn further, which could compromise the king's safety.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8 15. f4 Bh5 16. Rac1 Rac8 17.

Black prepares to operate on the h-file.,True,"

The comment accurately points out a critical mistake, as Black's move does not aim to strengthen their position or create any beneficial pressure along the h-file.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8 15. f4 Bh5 16. Rac1 Rac8 17.

White gets the king off the dangerous h-file.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it refers to a defensive move rather than addressing the issue with the previous move.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8 15. f4 Bh5 16. Rac1 Rac8 17.

? This square is needed for the king.,True,"

The comment likely refers to the player's mistake of moving their king out of safety without having a clear escape square, which could lead to vulnerability in the game.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Ne4 11. Bf4 g5 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. Bxd6 Nxd6 14. Ne5 Be8 15. f4 Bh5 16. Rac1 Rac8 17.

Qf2,"This is a game between Gurevich, Dmitry (as White) and Schiller, Eric (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to f2"
"It looks as though Black cannot make further progress. It is true that I have exhausted the possibilities on the h-file, but there is another path to the enemy king, via the queenside, and with the next very subtle move I prepare a deep and long plan",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, indicating a missed opportunity for a long-term attack plan.",1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. O-O Qe7 8.

"Had Dmitry figured out the point of my last move, he never would have opened up the b-file.",True,"
