It seems that this move allows white to consolidate in relative peace. The knight eventually looks nice on g4 too.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player likely gave up a strong position or a material advantage without adequate compensation.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7.

Last move played: White plays Knight to f2", The knight move to f2 doesn't provide significant strategic benefits for White.
Apparently the best defensive try. The queen wants to help the defense via c2.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as the move was indeed a defensive effort, but it does not highlight the specific error committed.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Kortchnoi was depending on a diversion with ... d3-d2, but this doesn't pan out and his queen is out of the defense.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out the failed attempt at creating a diversion (... d3-d2) and the resulting vulnerability of the queen.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

Perhaps the only blemish on an otherwise fine model game for this whole variation.,True,"

The comment implies that the recent move, while it did not ruin the game, was not as strong as it could have been, indicating a mistake.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6.
