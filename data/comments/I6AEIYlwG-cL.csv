A30: Symmetrical English: Double Fianchetto and Hedgehog,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it refers to a strategic approach (Symmetrical English with Double Fianchetto and Hedgehog) rather than addressing an error in the specific move played.",1. Nf3,"This is a game between Kramnik, V. (as White) and Topalov, V. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f3",-
Black gets more space,False,"

The comment does not explain why the move was a mistake, as gaining more space does not necessarily indicate a problem with the move.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 e6 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6.

Nb5,"This is a game between Kramnik, V. (as White) and Topalov, V. (as Black).

The bishop likes it on c4,False,"

The comment ""The bishop likes it on c4"" does not explain the mistake made by the player as it only provides information about the position of the bishop, without indicating why the move was incorrect.",1.

puts the final touch,False,"

This comment does not adequately explain the mistake made by the player. It suggests that the move was a finishing move, which contradicts the evaluation of the move as a mistake.",1.

Black threatens to counter with Rxg2,True,"

The comment accurately highlights the mistake made by the black player, as Rxg2 would have been a strong counterattack, ignoring the potential threats and weaknesses in the position.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 e6 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O d6 7. b3 Nbd7 8. Bb2 Be7 9. d4 O-O 10. d5 exd5 11. Nh4 g6 12. cxd5 Ne8 13. f4 Nc7 14. e4 b5 15. e5 f5 16. a4 b4 17. Nb5 Nxb5 18. axb5 Qb6 19.

The move might leave 'Black' exposed to a counterattack."
Theme: Double Attack,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player as it merely describes a chess concept (Double Attack) without analyzing the specific move that was played.",1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3.
