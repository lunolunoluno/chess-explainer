"As in a Caro-Kann variation Black accepts that Pg7 is weak and must be defended this awkward way. However, Qg4 is exposed and Pd4 & Ne5 are ill-supported, so Black has plenty of chances to survive. Perhaps one of the more important details is that White needs to retreat Ne5 to avoid another minor piece exchange. The more exchanges the easier it will be for Black to complete his development and the harder it would be for White to generate an attack.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic vulnerability that could be addressed.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"To this point Black has made nine pawn moves compared to White's four. Certainly the extra four moves could have been used by Black to keep his king safer and his pieces more active; but at the beginning it seemed so much easier.

Malcolm Pein: John H tells me GK made the control with a couple of minutes to spare. Looks like he missed the kill first time round. MH: This almost looks like an admission his attack has run out of steam. If he can't move Rd6 with an effective discovery on Rc7 and if he can't break through the light squares around Kf7 then Black might be only a little worse (his king is still less secure than Kg1) .,True," The comment offers a plausible explanation of the mistake, suggesting the player's attack has weakened due to a lack of decisive development and a potential vulnerability to Black's counterattack.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"The capture works after all. 38...Qxe6 allows 39. Qg7+ to win Rh8 and 38...Ke6 allows 39. Rd6+ which wins Qf6. This relentless attack wasn't so flashy as many, but it was very accurate and showed the pawns can't leave a king exposed without major consequences. In this case the defense was good, but the position was (apparently) irreparable. That the White pieces won this and the Adams-Anand games using this same (new to my knowledge) opening idea is notable. Anand didn't lose because of it, he misplayed a queen and pawn ending, but Ponomariov never quite recovered from the positional weaknesses around his king, created during the opening and early middle-game.
