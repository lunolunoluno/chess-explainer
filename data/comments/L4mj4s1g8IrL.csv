"Before this tournament I'd have said this was a pretty good way to aim for a draw. But, the Adams-Anand game showed a new plan which should be studied closely.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player because it references a famous game where a different strategy proved successful, suggesting that the player should have studied and applied a new approach instead of aiming for a draw.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e4"
Kasparov follows in the footsteps of Adams. Pc3 defends Pd5 and clears the way for Qd1-a4.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it does not provide information on why the move was a mistake, nor does it address any potential consequences of the move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to c3"
else White plays b2-b4 and makes it extremely difficult for Black to get any queen-side,True,"
The comment accurately explains the potential mistake by White, as advancing the pawn to b4 can indeed put pressure on Black's position and limit their queen-side mobility.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to c5"
The aim of this is to exploit the weak a4-e8 diagonal.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the specific strategic intention behind the move, which was to target a weakness in the opponent's position on the a4-e8 diagonal.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to e5"
"As in a Caro-Kann variation Black accepts that Pg7 is weak and must be defended this awkward way. However, Qg4 is exposed and Pd4 & Ne5 are ill-supported, so Black has plenty of chances to survive. Perhaps one of the more important details is that White needs to retreat Ne5 to avoid another minor piece exchange. The more exchanges the easier it will be for Black to complete his development and the harder it would be for White to generate an attack.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistakes made by the player, pointing out the weaknesses in Black's position and the potential for Black to gain an advantage with careful play.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays King to f8"
"Kasparov has a lot of courage. Here he offers a pawn, so he can spend the tempo developing pieces. He obviously thinks there's a way to fight for a win if his piece activity is sufficient.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake as it suggests Kasparov's intent to develop his pieces and potentially engage in an advantageous fight, indicating a strategic risk rather than a blunder.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays kingside castle"
"I'm not sure why he's allowing White to capture at f6 to double his f-file pawns, exposing Kf8 a little. Perhaps he thinks he'll be able to play ...Rh8-g8 to help his own piece development.",True,"

The comment accurately identifies the potential mistake in underestimating the threat posed by White's doubled f-file pawns and the possibility of Kf8 being exposed, which could lead to a weakening of the black king's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to c7"
threat: Rd1-d8+,True,"

The comment accurately describes the mistake made by the player, which was an overlooked check with the rook moving to d8.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen takes on g5"
threat: Qh5-e8#,True,"

The comment explains the mistake because it highlights a direct threat made by the opposing player, where their queen places the opponent's king in checkmate, indicating a severe oversight in the previous move.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h5"
Pawns don't generally fight pieces very well. The pawns move to block and the pieces just go around them.,False,"

The comment does not specifically address the nature of the mistake made by the player.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10.

Bd3 f5,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to f5"
"But sometimes, to break through a mass of pawns and when a piece sac. isn't going to be enough, another pawn must be used.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake as the player opted for a pawn sacrifice that failed to create the necessary breakthrough in the opponent's pawn structure.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 f5 22. g4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to g4"
Malcolm Pein: Ponomariov had been playing much quicker than Kasparov and his next couple of moves came quite fast to my surprise.,False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, but rather provides context about Ponomariov's playing style.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 f5 22. g4 Qf6,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to f6"
One by one White attacks a weakness and Black defends. If White can find two weaknesses (or create them) Black will be hard-pressed to hang on.,True,"

The comment explains that White's move was a mistake because it did not effectively create or exploit a weakness in Black's position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 f5 22. g4 Qf6 23. Rd1 b5 24. Be2 e5 25. Rhd3 Ra7 26. Rd6 Qg7 27. Qe3 Rc7,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to c7"
"To this point Black has made nine pawn moves compared to White's four. Certainly the extra four moves could have been used by Black to keep his king safer and his pieces more active; but at the beginning it seemed so much easier. It's like watching a small snowball rolling down a hill, growing larger and faster as it goes.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by highlighting the disadvantage of Black's slower development and potential vulnerability due to the lack of active pieces compared to White's more advanced position.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 f5 22. g4 Qf6 23. Rd1 b5 24. Be2 e5 25. Rhd3 Ra7 26. Rd6 Qg7 27. Qe3 Rc7 28. a4 e4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to e4"
"Is there's still no way for Rh8 to move into play? Apparently Pc5 is too weak to spend any ""free"" tempos on general piece activation.",False,"

The comment does not directly explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to suggest a hypothetical scenario where Rh8 could be played, instead of addressing the actual move that was made.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19.

Malcolm Pein: John H tells me GK made the control with a couple of minutes to spare. Looks like he missed the kill first time round. MH: This almost looks like an admission his attack has run out of steam. If he can't move Rd6 with an effective discovery on Rc7 and if he can't break through the light squares around Kf7 then Black might be only a little worse (his king is still less secure than Kg1) .,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, suggesting that the attack has stalled and the player's king is less secure than expected.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20.

Qf4,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to f4"
"He avoids the most obvious discovery, Rd6xe6.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as avoiding the obvious discovery move like Rd6xe6 suggests the player missed a clear tactical opportunity.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19.

threatening Rd6xg6 (again),False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it repeats the same threat mentioned before without providing any new insight into the error.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19. Rd3 a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 f5 22. g4 Qf6 23. Rd1 b5 24. Be2 e5 25. Rhd3 Ra7 26. Rd6 Qg7 27. Qe3 Rc7 28. a4 e4 29. axb5 axb5 30. Bxb5 Qe5 31. Qg5 Qe7 32. Qh6 Be6 33. Qf4 Bc8 34. Qh6,"This is a game between Kasparov, Garri (as White) and Ponomariov, Ruslan (as Black). Last move played: White plays Queen to h6"
"The capture works after all. 38...Qxe6 allows 39. Qg7+ to win Rh8 and 38...Ke6 allows 39. Rd6+ which wins Qf6. This relentless attack wasn't so flashy as many, but it was very accurate and showed the pawns can't leave a king exposed without major consequences. In this case the defense was good, but the position was (apparently) irreparable. That the White pieces won this and the Adams-Anand games using this same (new to my knowledge) opening idea is notable. Anand didn't lose because of it, he misplayed a queen and pawn ending, but Ponomariov never quite recovered from the positional weaknesses around his king, created during the opening and early middle-game. Kasparov takes the lead in the tournament with only one round to go!",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it points out that the rook cannot chase the queen without winning the pawn, which the commenter had already analyzed.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. c3 c5 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Qg4 Kf8 11. O-O Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bg5 Bf6 14. Rad1 Qc7 15. Qh4 Bxg5 16. Qxg5 f6 17. Qh5 g6 18. Qh6+ Kf7 19.
