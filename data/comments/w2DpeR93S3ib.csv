What is the logic behind this move? Morphy understands that in order to attack he will need to open up the f-file by advancing the pawn at f7 to f5. But the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal would prevent that. So the king moves from g8.,True," The comment attempts to justify the move by referencing a strategic concept, but it doesn't fully explain why the move is flawed.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.

"There is no rush to capture this pawn. In fact, it will sit at f5 for most of the game.

"Why retreat? Couldn't White capture the pawn? With the king still sitting at e1, the e-file would prove dangerous. Try playing the position as White against Gambit, and capture the pawn.

"There are three White pieces near the king, but they are not well-posted for defensive duties.
