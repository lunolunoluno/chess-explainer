"What to say? Nine moves of ""book"" so far, and we ain't even got started yet. I don't know if anybody still bothers to think about these things conceptually, but it has always helped me to remind myself at this point why I am sacking a pawn. Right, it clears the 'b' and 'c' files and the h8-a1, h7-b1 diagonals, all of which lead to white's king.

"So I had forced c2-c4, developed my pieces, now what to do? If things went ideally, now I would buckle down and find the winning combination. Instead my 30 minute think produced nothing at all.

"14...Qb8 is also interesting. 14...Qb7 had been scoring badly at the top level recently, but that kind of cutting-edge theory rarely filters down to affect my games.
