"This is reasonable, but it is known that black gets a good game in the Berlin Defense (which is ...Nf6 without ...a6 in the Ruy Lopez). I prefer either 4. d3 or 4.

"Dubious. Now white can try 6. Nxg5 Qxg5 7. d4 (notice this move causes the c1 bishop to hit the black queen) to try to fight for the initiative. Instead 5. ... Nd6 would give black equality with no problems. For example, 5. ... Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 (to open up the diagonally for the light-squared bishop) 7. Nxe5 Be7, with a very reasonable game for black.",True," The comment offers a plausible alternative move and analysis, suggesting a strategic adjustment to mitigate the potential initiative loss.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Why not 7. d4 straight away? Normally in Ruy Lopez, c3 is needed to help get in the d4 push, but not here. There was nothing preventing white from playing 7. d4 and 8. Nc3, completing development.",True, The comment provides a valid point about the importance of c3 in the Ruy Lopez and suggests a missed opportunity.,1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5.

"Here the computer does a strong multi-purpose move. ...c6 does the following: a) frees the black d-pawn to move (it was pinned before) b) opens the a5-d8 diagonal for the black queen, and c) helps establish a strong pawn center on d5.",True," The comment describes a move that significantly weakens the black pawn structure, suggesting a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2.

"A natural move, but a little too mechanical. The bishop has good scope on c1. White's best chance for an advantage is a king-side buildup. Here, I would choose 11. Nbd2, with the idea of Nd2-f1-g3 and Bc2, and you can see a lot of pressure on black's king-side.",True," The comment offers a potential alternative and suggests a strategic approach, indicating a misunderstanding of the move’s implications.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Definitely a mistake. The general rule of thumb is: If you have more than one pawn that can recapture take toward the center. In this case, that would be 14. hxg3. The only time you don't follow this principle, is something VERY specific is to be gained by not doing so. Here, this opens the f-line, but that leads to nothing. Also, this loosens the g1-a7 diagonal. As we'll see later in the game, black takes advantage of this fact.",True," The comment offers a specific reason for the mistake, suggesting a strategic misstep.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4.

"A natural move, but this sets up black's sacrifice of a piece for 2 pawns. Notice that if your pawn was on f2, black would only get 2 pawns, because then the recapture on d4 wouldn't be check, and you could defend your b-pawn.",True," The comment identifies a specific tactical error and explains why it’s a mistake, providing context.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Sometimes 3 pawns are worth a pieces, sometimes not. In this case, black gets connected, passed (passed pawn = pawn unopposed by enemy pawns), and MOBILE center pawns, so it's worth it. If the black pawns had no mobility (such as if they were blockaded), then it wouldn't be.",True," The comment offers a justification for the move's perceived value, suggesting the pawns' mobility is crucial.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Instead of this, 20. Rb1 Qf6 21. Qe2 (notice the rook isn't hanging in this line) ...Rfe8 22.

"As ugly as it may look, 30. Qxe2 was the only way to play on.
