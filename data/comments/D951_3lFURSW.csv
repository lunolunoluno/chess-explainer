"So far you and your opponent have played ""book"" moves. In other words these moves are already known. It is impressive that you and your opponent have picked through the maze this deep into the game. You need to be wary of being lead to the slaughter. Never take on an opponent in their territory. You can avoid the Petroff/Russian Defense with 3. Nc3. This will get you back into lines you probably know and positions where you are comfortable. At the very least, you take your opponent out of his specialty.",True," The comment provides a specific suggestion to avoid a known opening and a tactical threat, suggesting a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2.

"At this point you vary from ""book."" The old thought is that the first to stray from the lines of the past either gets their head handed to them or they have a brilliant idea. In this case, you get your head. You have many problems -> the open d - file, the half open f - file, the non-development of the Queenside pieces, Black's control of the middle, weak King position. (All tactics are based on positional elements.) Somehow you must buy some time to develop your pieces. Not to question theory, but you should go back and understand how this line has led you to a miserable position.

"Chess lesson #1: Black takes advantage of a ""pivot point."" This is the square(s) that the Bishop uses to attack the same side of the board that it sits on. Often we see a Bishop cutting across a diagonal but the real danger comes from these pivot points where suddenly it is attacking back across the grain. This move is brought to you courtesy of your lack of development.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, but it's overly simplistic and doesn't fully address the underlying strategic flaw.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Now your Rook is not on the back row. There is nothing to defend against the back row checkmate. Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a tactical shot. c3 Ouch, this is probably the only move that looses. You should have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development on you, you can not afford the time to chase pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing to move the Bishop of the ""dangerous diagonal"" (the diagonal that bears down on your f2/f7 square). You are completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2: Development is more important than breathing! Chess in a sense is a war game where you must mobilize your troops. If you do not, you insure an easy game for your opponent. Again, this is another computer like mistake. Play more live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open files. The one that is going to seal your fate is the d - file. (Chess lesson #4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent puts together two common patterns. Bxe4 Pattern #1: The decoy. This decoy had the added bite of actually creating extra possibilities on f2. Pattern #2: Clearing the file. Both of these are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time on learning these basic patterns. Qxf2",True," The comment provides specific tactical analysis and strategic advice, suggesting the player's move was flawed due to lack of development and strategic misdirection.",1. e4 e5 2.

"Ng4 Chess lesson #5: Imbalances. An imbalance is any difference in the position. At this point you are 2 Bishops & Rook verses Queen and Pawn. Not bad as far as material is concerned. However, look at how the Knight dominates both your Bishops and Rook. This is called the ""superior minor piece."" In spite of your material differences, you are playing a virtual Rook, Knight, and Bishop down (pieces that have not been developed). Black also has his pick of the d - file, the f - file, and the a7 - g1 diagonal.
