"This move is sometimes used as an example of Lasker's well known skill in applying the psychological element to chess. The objectively best move here is 11..f6, which would open the king bishop file and allow Black to make use of his more active pieces. However, Lasker feels that for this particular opponent it will be psychologically more difficult if he plays more aggressively and goes over to the attack. The reason? Marshall was a player who always strove for the initiative, and he was one of the greatest attacking and combinative players of all time. The defense was an uncomfortable and unfamiliar role for him.",True," The comment provides context about Lasker's strategic thinking and the psychological impact of the move, suggesting the mistake was a result of a flawed strategic approach.",1. e4 e5 2.
