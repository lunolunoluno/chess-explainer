"This move is objectively much less strong than 4. 0-0, but it leads to the type of open game that Marshall loved.",True,"

The comment recognizes the inferior quality of the move but acknowledges its potential to open up a game similar to one preferred by Marshall.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to d4," The move played by White is less strong compared to 4. 0-0, but it results in an open game that Marshall favored."
"Developing the bishop and preparing to castle. 5.. Nxe5 would lead to a disadvantage after 6. Re1, d5 7. Nxd4.",True,"

The comment accurately highlights the potential disadvantage of playing Nxe5, as it could lead to a position that allows White to gain a better control over the center and develop a strong advantage after the mentioned moves.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Bishop to e7," 'White is developing their bishop and preparing to castle. If Black takes the knight with 5... Nxe5, White can respond with 6. Re1, followed by Black's pawn move d5 and White's knight capture with 7. Nxd4, creating a disadvantage for Black.'"
"This pawn on the fifth rank cramps Black's king position . On the other hand, Black may be able to play f6 at some time and open a file for his rook. In some circumstances, the advanced pawn may even become weak and subject to attack. Unlike any other chess piece, a pawn can not move backwards!",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it covers the consequences of the pawn's placement, its potential to become weak, and the inability of a pawn to move backwards.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5," White's pawn to e5 restricts Black's king position. While Black could potentially play f6 later to open a file for their rook, the pawn on e5 could become vulnerable. Unlike any other chess piece, a pawn cannot move backward."
"There is no other square on the which this knight could find security. At e5, it can be protected by d4, and if White takes it e.p. d6, the knight can recapture.",True,"

The comment accurately assesses the player's mistake by highlighting the lack of a safe square for the knight and providing a potential recapture strategy if the opponent takes the knight.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Knight to e4," Given the move by Black, the knight's position on e4 seems risky. At e5, the knight could be covered by White's pawn at d4, and should White capture on e5, the knight has the potential to recapture on d6."
Regaining the pawn.,False,"

The comment ""Regaining the pawn"" does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it seems to be a response that suggests a corrective action rather than an evaluation of the error in the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight takes on d4,-
"Continuing his developement. 7..Nxe5?? would lose a piece after 8. Re1, f5 9. f3.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake by highlighting that 7...Nxe5 would lead to a loss of a piece if the opponent responds with 8. Re1 followed by 9. f3.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays kingside castle," After Marshall's 7th move, Black initiated a risky action with 7...Nxe5. This move turns out to be problematic as White has several strong responses. Black's 8th move of castling kingside is the first, but White's 8...Re1 exposes Black's king to an attack. Following that, White's 9th move, f3, would put pressure on Black's knight and lead to the loss of a valuable piece."
"To exchange this knight for Black's king bishop, which would give White the two bishops and leave Black slightly vulnerable on the dark squares.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player by highlighting the exchange of the knight for Black's king bishop, leading to material advantage for White but potentially creating weaknesses on the dark squares for Black.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to f5," ""Exchanging the knight for Black's bishop puts White at a disadvantage, gaining only two bishops but creating weaknesses on Black's dark squares."""
"This developing move protects his knight on e5, and opens the diagonal of his queen bishop, which now threatens White's knight.",False,"

The comment incorrectly describes the situation as White's move, whereas the move being evaluated is presumably Black's.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to d5,-
"The move that had usually been played here was 9. Nxe7+, and this is probably best. After the following exchanges, a position arises in which Black has an advantage in developement, and also pressure against White's king pawn. The situation is by no means one sided, however; Black has some vulnerability on the dark squares and his broken up pawns on the queen side are weak.",True,"

The annotation correctly explains the mistake by highlighting the potential advantage Black gains in development and pressure against White's king pawn, as well as mentioning Black's vulnerabilities.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop takes on c6," The move played, Bishop to c6, was generally considered suboptimal. After this move and the subsequent exchanges, Black ends up with a slight developmental edge. They also have increased pressure on White's king pawn. However, this position isn't one-sided; Black's dark square weaknesses and the fragmented pawns on their queen side present some vulnerabilities."
"This move which indirectly protects the king pawn, is forced. If 11. Bf4?, f6 12. f6, Rxf6 and White already behind in developement, must lose more time. If f3??, Qc5+ 12. Kh1, Nf2+ wins the exchange. If Black now plays 11. Qxe5??, 12. f3 wins a piece.",True,"

The comment accurately describes why the move was a mistake, as it outlines the potential tactical consequences and disadvantages of the move.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to e1," The move to protect the king pawn is forced but risky. If White tries to develop with 11. Bf4?, Black can play f6, leading to 12. f6 Rxf6, putting White at a development disadvantage. Also, if f3 is played by White, it allows Black to play Qc5+, after which 12. Kh1 Nf2+ would give Black the exchange. Furthermore, a blunder by Black with 11. Qxe5?? would result in White winning a piece after 12. f3."
"This move is sometimes used as an example of Lasker's well known skill in applying the psychological element to chess. The objectively best move here is 11..f6, which would open the king bishop file and allow Black to make use of his more active pieces. However, Lasker feels that for this particular opponent it will be psychologically more difficult if he plays more aggressively and goes over to the attack. The reason? Marshall was a player who always strove for the initiative, and he was one of the greatest attacking and combinative players of all time. The defense was an uncomfortable and unfamiliar role for him.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it justifies the aggressive move (11..f6) as a strategic choice to exploit the opponent's psychology, considering Marshall's preference for the initiative and attacking.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Queen to h4," Lasker's move was not optimal, as it didn't align with the best strategic play. The ideal move would have been 11..f6, opening the king bishop's file. Lasker's choice to play less aggressively could be attributed to a psychological tactic against White, who thrives on initiative and attacking. This move, while cautious, might not have effectively leveraged Lasker's active pieces or exploited White's potential weaknesses."
Guarding his threatened f2. If 12. f3 at once was probably also good.,True,"

The comment explains the mistake made by the player as it suggests that if the player had immediately played f3, it would have been a good move, implying that the delay in playing f3 allowed for the loss of material or a disadvantageous position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to e3," White's last move lacked proactive defense since Black's f2 pawn could be easily targeted. It's more prudent to prepare for f3 defensively, ensuring the king's safety later in the game."
To drive the knight away from the attack.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it suggests that the knight was moved to a position where it was no longer in a threatening location, making it easier for the opponent to gain an advantage.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f3," ""Black overextends, attempting to dislodge the knight without solid support."""
An elegant and most surprising sacrifice.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as a poor move, but rather highlights an unexpected sacrifice which could be a strategic choice, not necessarily a mistake.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3 fxe5,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn takes on e5,-
Black's attack is to strong for White to avoid simplification.,True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it points out that Black's aggressive position has made it difficult for White to find a viable defense, leading to a potential simplification of the position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3 fxe5 14. fxe4 d4 15. g3 Qf6 16. Bxd4 exd4 17. Rf1,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to f1," White's rook move to f1 allows Black to simplify the position, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome for White."
"Black appears to have only a shade of advantage in this ending. His bishop is better than White's knight and his pieces will come into action faster than White's. But as usual, his weak queenside pawns affect the picture. Once White plays his knight to b3, they will be under considerable pressure. Now, however, Lasker with an almost magical charm finds away to obtain a decisive advantage.",False,"

The comment does not directly address the mistake made by the player, but rather provides an overall evaluation of the position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7.

Kxf1,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: White plays King takes on f1,-
"Instead of giving a bishop check on a6 or h3, Black plays this surprising but far stronger move. By forcing White's reply, Black denies White's knight the crucial b3 square.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it highlights the missed opportunity to create pressure on White's position by denying the knight access to the b3 square.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3 fxe5 14. fxe4 d4 15. g3 Qf6 16. Bxd4 exd4 17. Rf1 Qxf1+ 18. Qxf1 Rxf1+ 19. Kxf1 Rb8,This is a game between Marshall (as White) and Lasker (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to b8," Black's choice to move the Rook to b8 instead of opting for a stronger Bishop maneuver to a6 or h3 was a surprising move. This Rook placement forces White to react, specifically preventing the Knight's potential control of the b3 square."
"Still leaving his bishop at home, Black moves his rook to an active position on the fourth rank. To his frustration, White now finds that he can not develop his knight. If 21. Nd2, Rh5 22. Kg1 Rc5 23. Rc1. (If 23. Nc4, Bh3. ) 23..Ba6 threatening Bd3, and White is helpless. To avoid this, White is forced to advance his bishop pawn to the forth rank, which will give Black a passed queen pawn.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player because it correctly identifies the consequence of the Black player's rook move, which led to the White player's inability to develop their knight and the potential threat of a passed queen pawn.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3 fxe5 14. fxe4 d4 15. g3 Qf6 16. Bxd4 exd4 17. Rf1 Qxf1+ 18.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to b5," Black's rook maneuver to b5 blocks the b-file, hindering White's knight development. White must move their bishop pawn to b3, which threatens a passed c-pawn for Black if the center opens up."
"Forces White to take a move to protect his queen rook pawn, thereby giving White no time to play b4 to stop Black from playing c5.",True,"
The comment accurately explains the mistake as it highlights the consequences of the move, forcing White to make a defensive move, and leaves White without a countermove to prevent Black from advancing their position.",1. e4 e5 2.

Last move played: Black plays Rook to h5," White's previous move leaves their queen rook pawn unprotected, offering Black a chance to advance with c5, putting pressure on White's position without allowing a break with b4."
Now it is a protected passed pawn.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake as it describes a potential advantage (protected passed pawn) that could result from a subsequent move, not the error in the previous move.",1. e4 e5 2.

"If Black delayed developing his king, White would play 24. Rf1 and temporarily keep it out of the game.",True,"
The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player because it accurately describes a potential strategic response to Black's decision to not delay developing their king, which could lead to White's rook becoming active and threatening the position.",1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Be7 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. Nf5 d5 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. Nxe7+ Qxe7 11. Re1 Qh4 12. Be3 f6 13. f3 fxe5 14. fxe4 d4 15. g3 Qf6 16. Bxd4 exd4 17. Rf1 Qxf1+ 18.

"Whites only chance was 24. a3, attempting 25. b4 to eliminate the protector of Black's passed pawn.",True,"

"The fourth rank now occupied by his bishop pawn, Black places his rook on the third rank, which by reason of the removal of this same pawn is now the most active rank.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake made by the player, as it identifies the incorrect placement of the bishop pawn on the fourth rank, which then allowed the opponent to position their rook on the more active third rank.",1. e4 e5 2.

47. Nb7 (Bad Move) - Black's knight move to b7 creates weaknesses without any tangible benefit.
47... Ke3 (Not Necessary) - Black may consider this move, but it does not capitalize on White's position.
