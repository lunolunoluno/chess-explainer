Unlike the Dragon Variation the Accelerated Dragon allows White to play c2-c4 (Maroczy Bind) . This gives White a terrific grip on d5 and shortens Black's part of the open c-file. Black's trump is that White won't be castling queen-side and then launching the St. George's attack on the h-file at Black's king. Both sides usually castle king-side and fight it out all over the board.,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player because it actually highlights the advantages of the move, rather than pointing out its inaccuracy or potential issues.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Pawn to g6"
This is a little different. More common is Bf1-e2. After the game move Nd4 remains weak for a move or two longer.,True,"

The comment accurately points out that the move Bf1-e2 is more common and that the knight move Nd4 might have been weaker than other potential moves, possibly indicating a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Bishop to g5"
"So, Polgar immediately removes it from the weak square (much as one might with the Black pieces in an English Opening Reversed, Maroczy Bind for Black) .",True,"
The comment accurately describes that Polgar made a strategic move that eliminates a potential weakness in the position, similar to the strategies used in the English Opening Reversed and Maroczy Bind for Black.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Knight to c2"
"threatening to capture Bg5 or ...Nxe4 since Nc3 is now pinned. However, it might have been better to leave both e5 & a5 available to Nc6.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the player's mistake in not considering the potential for counterplay and maintaining pawn structure, which could have offered more dynamic options for later stages of the game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black).

evacuating the dark-square diagonal to get out of range of Bg7 and preparing for the c-file fight,False,"

The comment does not explain the mistake made by the player, as it provides a potential strategic plan rather than addressing the error in the move itself.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Rook to c1"
"With Qa5 it seemed obvious Black would try for ...Nc6-e5 to threaten Pc4, so f2-f4 takes that away. Curiously, as in the English Opening game against Shirov, Polgar is using her pawns quite a lot to restrain the opponent. Of course it's risky to move pawns too much and exposed pawns require some defense, but if the opponent isn't careful it can turn into a landslide where their pieces never become active and the pawns advance to create an offensive threat.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by explaining the potential threat posed by Black's Nc6-e5 and suggests a better defensive move, f2-f4, to counter it.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1 Rac8 13. f4,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to f4"
"Black prepares the ...Qa5-b6+, so Bd2-e3, Kg1-h1 or b2-b3 are immediately candidates to consider.",True,"

The comment correctly identifies the mistake by pointing out the potential threats against the white king after black's queen moves to b6, indicating the inaccuracy of the Bd2 move.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1 Rac8 13. f4 Rfe8,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: Black plays Rook to e8"
"White takes a shot at immediate activity to counter Black's on the c-file. Usually this wouldn't work, but there are instances (exceptions sort of) where it can work. In this case I'm wondering where Nf6 will go.",True,"

The comment explains the mistake by pointing out a risky attempt to gain immediate activity against Black's control of the c-file, while also questioning the future placement of Black's knight.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1 Rac8 13. f4 Rfe8 14. a3 Qb6+ 15. Kh1 Na5 16. e5,"This is a game between Polgar, Judit (as White) and Granero Roca, A. (as Black). Last move played: White plays Pawn to e5"
"Polgar prefers to guard Pc2 and square b3, preventing ...Na5-b3, and keeping her queen-side coordination intact rather than grubbing a pawn with Bxh5. Of course, that may change quickly. Moving Nc2-e3 may just be part of a plan to maneuver everything toward Kg8.",True,"

The comment accurately explains the mistake, as it highlights Polgar's strategy to protect her position and suggests that the pawn move may have been an oversight rather than a part of a bigger plan.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1 Rac8 13. f4 Rfe8 14. a3 Qb6+ 15. Kh1 Na5 16. e5 Nh5 17. Nd5 Qd8 18.

White's position is looking a bit loose and it's just the stranded Nh5 which looks terribly awkward for Black.,True,"

The comment accurately highlights the strategic blunder of the stranded knight (Nh5) in White's position, indicating it's potentially a mistake.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. Nc2 O-O 9. Be2 Qa5 10. Bd2 a6 11. O-O Bd7 12. Rc1 Rac8 13. f4 Rfe8 14. a3 Qb6+ 15. Kh1 Na5 16. e5 Nh5 17. Nd5 Qd8 18. Nce3 e6 19. Bxa5 Qxa5 20.

"That Polgar has arranged to ""arrive"" at this position is interesting. It's one where Nh5 is still stranded, but White has made Nc4, Pe5 and Qd1 work together to restrain or even beat Black's central position! It's very difficult to find a good continuation for Black.",True,"

The comment accurately points out the mistake by explaining how White's moves (Nc4, Pe5, and Qd1) combine to control Black's central position and limit Black's options, making it difficult for Black to find a good continuation.",1. e4 c5 2.

"First Polgar tried to cramp him, but when the time was right she flung it open and bashed Black's king. It took some nifty footwork in the middle-game to make the transition, but she did it nicely.",True,"

The comment correctly explains the mistake made by the player, highlighting the strategic error and the successful transition in the middle-game.",1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4.
