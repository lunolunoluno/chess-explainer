Unlike the Dragon Variation the Accelerated Dragon allows White to play c2-c4 (Maroczy Bind) . This gives White a terrific grip on d5 and shortens Black's part of the open c-file. Black's trump is that White won't be castling queen-side and then launching the St. George's attack on the h-file at Black's king. Both sides usually castle king-side and fight it out all over the board.,True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic disadvantage for Black.",1. e4 c5 2.

"With Qa5 it seemed obvious Black would try for ...Nc6-e5 to threaten Pc4, so f2-f4 takes that away. Curiously, as in the English Opening game against Shirov, Polgar is using her pawns quite a lot to restrain the opponent. Of course it's risky to move pawns too much and exposed pawns require some defense, but if the opponent isn't careful it can turn into a landslide where their pieces never become active and the pawns advance to create an offensive threat.",True," The comment offers a potential explanation for the mistake, suggesting a strategic analysis of pawn structure and potential for a tactical disaster.",1. e4 c5 2.

"White takes a shot at immediate activity to counter Black's on the c-file. Usually this wouldn't work, but there are instances (exceptions sort of) where it can work.

"Polgar prefers to guard Pc2 and square b3, preventing ...Na5-b3, and keeping her queen-side coordination intact rather than grubbing a pawn with Bxh5. Of course, that may change quickly.

"That Polgar has arranged to ""arrive"" at this position is interesting. It's one where Nh5 is still stranded, but White has made Nc4, Pe5 and Qd1 work together to restrain or even beat Black's central position!

"First Polgar tried to cramp him, but when the time was right she flung it open and bashed Black's king.
