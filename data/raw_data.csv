"This variation has a mixed reputation. On the one hand, Black concedes some space to White without much of a struggle, creating the pawn formation that Hans Kmoch would immortalize as the ""French Jump Formation."" On the other hand, Black's position resembles a brick: small, compact, hard to crack. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit fans are apt to play f3 here, counting on the materialistic nature of the average French player to make him munch the pawn.",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"Najdorf just takes it off: he's interested in fluid development with a slight but pleasant spatial advantage without a material sacrifice. (4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3 Nf6 By transposition, then, we'd have the Euwe Defense to the BDG. The Euwe Defense has a pretty good theoretical reputation at present thanks to endorsements from GM Joe Gallagher and the Watson & Schiller analytical team. But it's not clear that this reputation is deserved since there are some improvements for White on the aforementioned analysis. In any event, what makes the 4.f3 line less attractive for White is the fact that Black can simply ignore it, like so: 4...e3 Now White has no open f-file, his f-pawn stunts his Kingside development, and the pawn formation is otherwise the same as he would get by just taking the pawn on e4.)",1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

"How should we assess the position here? White's spatial advantage is worth the most when Black is cramped, with too many pieces on the board and too little space for maneuvering them. It makes good sense, therefore, for Black to swap off a pair of Knights. Makes sense -- but also takes time, and a single pair of Knights isn't all he'd like to get rid of.

"Najdorf, however, has a keener sense of the tactical usefulness of a N on e5. Black has three possible recaptures. Which one is best? 9...Nxf6 This is the most natural way to recapture -- yet it is precisely against this move that Najdorf's idea can be put into action. 10.Bb5+! Kf8 Because of the combined force of Bishop and Knight covering c6 and d7, Black is obliged to forfeit castling now.Perhaps you're thinking, ""So what? The King looks pretty safe on f8."" But the point is that in the long run Black's position will be even less coordinated than it is now -- he would have real difficulties getting his pieces into action.

"Despite the awkwardness of it, Shapiro should have taken with the Bishop. But he reasons thus: why not take with the pawn and get rid of that pesky N/e5 once and for all? Now if White backs up the Knight, Black can play f5, Nf6, Qd7 and 0-0-0 -- he might even be able to use the g-file for an attack on White's King later on.
