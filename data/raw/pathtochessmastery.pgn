{ [%mdl 8192] D10: Slav Defence: 3 cxd5 (without early Nf3) and 3 Nc3 } 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Bf4 { with the early bishop development, I felt that
this had more of the flavor of a London System with a pawn exchange, rather
than as a Slav Exchange variation. } 4... Nc6 { this is played the most often,
according to the database. It develops a piece and blocks the a4-e8 diagonal. } 5. Nc3 Bf5 { I spent a good amount of time on this and on the last move. The
bishop development is fine to play, but because of it I worried a lot about
potential Nb5-c7 vulnerabilities. } ( 5... Nf6 { followed by ...a6 seems like an
easier approach and is popular at top levels. } 6. Nb5 $2 { is premature because
of } 6... Qa5+ ) 6. e3 e6 7. Rc1 { this is a less common move here, but a logical
placement of the rook. } ( 7. Bb5 Ne7 8. Nf3 a6 9. Be2 Nc8 10. O-O Be7 11. Rc1 Nb6 12. Ne5 Nxe5 13. Bxe5 O-O 14. Qb3 Rc8 15. Na4 Nxa4 16. Qxa4 Bf6 17. Bxf6 gxf6 18. Qb4 Qd7 19. Qd2 Qa4 20. a3 Qb3 21. Qb4 Qxb4 { Ubilava,E (2560)

(2154)-Diakonova,E (2214) Loo 2019 1/2-1/2 (38) } ) 7... Bd6 { there is no reason
not to place the bishop here. } 8. Bxd6 Qxd6 $11 { the position is very equal,
as White no longer has any immediate targets - the pin on the Nc6 is easily
dealt with - and both sides need to develop further. } 9. Bb5 Ne7 10. f4 { indicates White will continue aggressively. This weakens the light squares on
the kingside, but since Black's knight is on e7 instead of f6, this is not
immediately exploitable. } 10... O-O 11. Nf3 { with the pawn on f4, the knight will be
better supported if it moves to e5 or g5. } 11... a6 { taking control of b5 } 12. Bxc6 Nxc6 { Black can now think about play on the queenside, with ideas of ...Nb4 or
...Na5-c4. The Bf5 would also be well-positioned to support this, which is why
White decides to get rid of it. } 13. Nh4 Ne7 { in a change in plans, the knight
is re-routed back to the kingside. The f5 square will be an excellent place
for it. } 14. Nxf5 Nxf5 $15 { attacking e3, weakened due to the f-pawn advance. } 15. Qd2 Qe7 { the thinking behind this is to improve the position of the queen.
It belongs on the dark squares and posted on e7 it has access to the useful
d8-h4 diagonal, as well as helping control the 7th rank. } ( 15... h5 $5 { Komodo approves of the text move, but slightly favors this pawn push. The
point is to secure the Nf5 from a g2-g4 pawn advance. While this violates the
general rule of not moving a pawn in front of your king, these types of moves
are common at master level. } ) 16. O-O Nd6 { I unfortunately start "losing the
thread" of the game here, by not coming up with a suitable plan. I thought the
knight would be better placed on d6, which is true if not urgent. I was also
thinking about the option of playing ...f5, which is not really beneficial to
me. By moving the knight yet again, it also neglects rook development in the
late opening/early middlegame, which is a typical Class player issue. } ( 16... Rfc8 { getting a presence on the c-file and the rook into play is strategically
better. } ) 17. b3 { a prophylactic move to control c4, denying the knight an
outpost there. } 17... f5 $6 { with ideas of a Rf6 rook lift that never materialize,
so this is an ultimately weakening strategic error. I should be playing in the
center and queenside, not trying to create something out of nothing on the
kingside. } ( 17... Rfc8 { with the simple but effective plan of doubling rooks
on the c-file makes sense. } ) 18. Na4 $11 b5 { while not technically bad in
itself, this move just makes it easier to play as White, driving the knight to
its best square. } ( 18... Ne4 $5 { is a great square for the Black knight and it
influences c5 as well. } ) 19. Nc5 a5 { this at least is a correct idea, fighting
for space on the queenside and being happy to open the a-file for my rook if
White seeks an exchange. } 20. a4 b4 { Komodo rates both this and the pawn
exchange equally. With White having a better-placed knight, I thought it was
better to seal the queenside rather than open it up. It should also simplify
planning. } 21. Rc2 Ne4 $6 { yet another move by this knight instead of
mobilizing the a8 rook, which now has nothing to do. This ends up giving White
too much control over the c-file, although it is not yet decisive. It also
creates an additional pawn island for Black. } ( 21... Rac8 $5 $11 ) 22. Nxe4 $14 fxe4 { we now have a Dutch structure with queen and rooks. From playing the
Dutch, however, I should have better known that when there is an open c-file,
this favors White. } 23. Rfc1 $6 ( 23. Qe2 Rac8 24. Rfc1 $14 ) 23... Ra7 $6 { the start of a flawed defensive plan. Ironically, having pursued a Dutch-type
strategy, the best continuation would be to play the thematic Dutch ...g5
break. } ( 23... g5 $5 $11 { would allow for counterplay on the kingside. Now
instead White has the initiative. } ) 24. Rc6 { my opponent does a good job of
identifying the most vulnerable target in my camp. The problem is that there
is no easy way to defend the e-pawn in the long term. } 24... Rd8 $6 { I took a long
time here to try to find a good defense. Time trouble starts to make an impact
now. } ( 24... g5 { is probably still best, although now of course the e-pawn
falls. } ) 25. Qc2 ( 25. Qe2 { would be more to the point, threatening to come to
g4. } ) 25... Rdd7 { the defensive idea of controlling the 7th rank was the point
behind the earlier rook move to d8. } 26. Rc8+ Kf7 27. Qe2 Qh4 { I spent a long
time here as well, trying to figure out how to cover the kingside. } ( 27... g6 $16 { would be a better way to hold out on the kingside. } ) 28. g3 Qh6 $2 { this error is a good (if painful) lesson on piece mobility and activity: the
Black queen is now almost literally painted into the corner. I considered
going to h3, which Komodo validates is best, but I erroneously thought it
would be worse off there. } ( 28... Qh3 $16 { prevents the White queen from
penetrating and also covers h7 and e6. } ) 29. Qf2 { I could still go to h3, but
instead play the ...g6 idea too late, making things worse not better. } 29... g6 $2 30. R1c6 ( 30. Kg2 { would cover h3 and ensure zero counterplay for Black. } ) 30... Ke7 $2 { still ignoring h3 } 31. Qe2 $6 { my opponent also is ignorant of
this idea. } 31... Rd6 $4 { this was a blunder played in time trouble, but my opponent
missed the finishing continuation. } 32. Qg4 ( 32. Rxd6 $1 Kxd6 33. Qb5 $18 { and Black's king and rook are too exposed to be defended. } ) 32... Rad7 { White is still winning here, but has a lot more work to do. } 33. Rc5 Ra7 { still trying to desperately defend everything } 34. Kg2 Rdd7 $2 { this allows an
interesting tactical idea, which I spotted after I moved, but my opponent did
not. Given the length of the calculation required, however, practically
speaking it probably did not make sense to play. } ( 34... Kf7 $18 ) 35. R5c6 { a simpler route to victory } ( 35. Re8+ $1 $142 { deflection tactic } 35... Kxe8 36. Qxe6+ Kd8 37. Qg8+ Ke7 38. Rc6 $18 { and Black gets mated or has to give up too
much material, for example } 38... Rd6 39. Rc8 Kf6 40. Rf8+ Qxf8 41. Qxf8+ Ke6 42. f5+ gxf5 43. Qh6+ Ke7 44. Qxh7+ Ke6 45. Qxa7 ) 35... Rd6 36. Re8+ Kxe8 37. Rxd6 Re7 38.

Qd8 { around here I started feeling better, if not exactly good, about my
situation. The queen defends both d5 and a5 and White no longer has as easy a
win. } 42. Qc5 h5 { the idea being to restrain the g-pawn and White's
mobilization of his 3-2 kingside majority. } 43. h3 { supporting a g4 push. } 43... Ke6 { trying to take some of the defensive burden away from the queen. } 44. Qc6+ { driving away the king. } 44...

anything I do will allow White to realize his advantage. } 48... Qg8 49. g4 Qf7 { still trying to fight hard on defense and give myself a chance. I in fact do
this, but unfortunately I miss it in time trouble and under pressure. } 50. Qc8 { White prepares the advance f5 } 50... Kh7 51. f5 $2 ( 51. Kg3 ) 51... Kg7 $2 { this

now. } ) 52. Kg3 Kh7 ( 52... gxf5 { does not help much due to } 53. g5 $1 ) 53. Kf4 Kg7 { now White has multiple ways to win and is in no danger. As long as the

1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 c6 { this is a committal move, but I was planning to play the
Stonewall in any case. } 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 f5 5. O-O Nf6 6. c4 Bd6 { we now have
the standard Modern Stonewall starting position from theory. } 7. Nc3 O-O 8. cxd5 exd5 { the general rule for an exchange on d5 in the Stonewall is to
recapture with the e-pawn. This keeps the c-file blocked, allows Black to use
the e-file for the heavy pieces, and gives the Bc8 more potential scope. } 9. Bg5 h6 { the direct approach. } ( 9... Qe8 $5 ) 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Qb3 { this move
should set off an alert, both for the pressure on b7 and the presence of the
queen on the a2-g8 diagonal, which means the d-pawn is now pinned. } 11... g5 $2 { I thought about sidestepping with Kh8, but didn't understand the urgency of
doing so. The text move of course is what Black wants to play, but needs to
better prepare it. } ( 11... Re8 $5 { is an active way of addressing White's
threat to advance the e-pawn, while developing the rook. The king can
subsequently go to h8. } ) 12. e4 $1 $16 { now White gets in this strong pawn
break for free, as the d-pawn is no longer controlling e4. } 12... fxe4 13. Nxe4 { now this knight, which was effectively doing nothing on c3, is quite strong.
White also has better prospects for controlling the e-file. } 13... Qe6 { breaking the
pin } 14. Nxd6 { by eliminating the dark-square bishop, this weakens Black's
ability to defend the entire dark-square complex, including the central square
e5. } 14... Qxd6 15. Rfe1 Qf6 { I thought for a long time here and couldn't find
anything better. The alternative would have been to start developing minor
pieces, but I assessed that the text move would pose White more practical
problems, given the pressure down the f-file. } ( 15... Nd7 { is what Komodo
prefers, trying to catch up on development. } ) 16. Re2 Bg4 17. Re3 Nd7 { White
grabbing the pawn on b7 would be OK by me, giving me some more counterplay
with the undeveloped rook. } 18. h3 $6 { this is essentially prompting me to
play the best, equalizing move. Which of course I do not do. } ( 18. Qxb7 Rab8 19. Qa6 Rxb2 $14 { and now } 20. Qxa7 $6 Nb6 $11 { with full positional
compensation for the pawn, as the knight will go to the strong c4 outpost and
the rook on the 2nd rank is very good. } ) ( 18. Rae1 $16 ) 18... Bf5 $2 { an
example of how a piece can look nice visually, in this case on the h7-b1
diagonal, but it is not in fact doing much useful there. It even blocks the
f-file pressure. } ( 18... Bxf3 $1 { an illustration of the power of piece
exchanges. This should be a rather obvious choice, getting rid of Black's
"bad" bishop - look at all the pawns on light squares - for White's good
knight. } 19. Bxf3 Nb6 $11 ) 19. Rae1 ( 19. g4 { would have pressed the advantage. } 19... Bg6 20. Qxb7 { now the Nd7 is hanging, so White can profitably take the pawn. } 20... Nb6 21. b3 $18 ) 19... g4 { pinning my hopes on active play rather than passive
defense with ...Rab8. } 20. Nh4 gxh3 $2 { this ignores my opponent's tactical
threats involving the d5 square, but in practical terms it does encourage his
next move, which gives away the advantage. } ( 20... Nb6 ) 21. Nxf5 $6 ( 21. Bxd5+ $1 { again we see the problems related to having the king remain on this
diagonal. } 21... cxd5 $18 { and White now has the pleasant choice between the simple
Qxd5 or Rf3. } ) 21... Qxf5 $11 22. Rf3 Qh5 23. g4 { I thought for a while here,
but could not calculate the best plan properly, already being stressed and
fatigued. } 23... h2+ ( 23... Qh4 $5 { I seriously considered, but I was too wedded to
keeping the h-pawn. Komodo gives } 24. Bxh3 Rxf3 25. Qxf3 Rf8 { and White has
nothing better than to simplify into an ending. } 26. Qg3 Qxg3+ 27. fxg3 Nf6 $15 ) 24. Kh1 Qh4 $6 { here I did not consider the capture on f3, because of the
threat to the queen; however, it is a dynamic (if complicated) way of dealing
with the position. } ( 24... Rxf3 25. Qxb7 Rb8 26. Qxb8+ Nxb8 27. gxh5 Rxf2 28. Re8+ Rf8 { and White has a slight edge, but nothing more. } ) 25. Qd3 { my
opponent prefers active threats on the kingside (Qg6+) to snatching the b-pawn. } 25... Rxf3 { this is still good and should be equal. } 26. Bxf3 Nf6 { this is OK, but
unnecessarily complicated. } ( 26... Nf8 $15 { nothing wrong with good defensive
play, taking away the g6 square from White. } ) 27. Qg6+ Kf8 $4 { when
calculating this, I missed my opponent's next follow-up, which wins. Fatigue
dulled my ability to properly calculate the two sequences. } ( 27... Kh8 28. Re7 { I mistakenly thought won for White, but Black holds after } 28... Rg8 $1 ) 28. Re6 $18 Ng8 29. Qf5+ Kg7 30. Rg6+ Kh7 31. Qf7+ 1-0

greater his advantage. } ( 12. Ng5 $5 Qd6 $17 ) 12... Nxe4 13. Qxe4 Qd5 $19 { powerfully centralizing the queen, with an x-ray attack on g2, as well as
offering to exchange pieces to Black's benefit. } 14. Qh4+ { the only way I saw
to keep the queens on the board. According to the engine this worsens White's
evaluation, but having the queens off in an endgame where my opponent has the

for the knight to go to d6 and perhaps to double rooks on the b-file. } ) 23. Qg3 Bd6 24. Qf3 { at this point I saw no obvious breakthroughs for Black, so took
the draw. Basically a lack of energy and patience was the reason, along with
not really understanding the needs of the position. These include the
importance of the b8-h2 diagonal and activating the bishop, the possible ...h5
advance, better and earlier development of the queen and rooks, etc. } 1/2-1/2

better to double the rooks on the f-file rather than leading with the queen.

for the bishop and allows Black's next move. I did not in fact have a concrete
plan here. } ( 27. Rgf3 Bf6 28. Rxf6 $1 gxf6 29. d5 $18 { and Black's king is

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 ( 4... Bf5 { is the other main choice
here to stay within the Slav Defense. It's largely a matter of taste which to
choose, although this variation offers White an easy route to exchange the Nf3
for the Bf5, if desired. } ) 5. cxd5 cxd5 { after the exchange of pawns, Black
now has to worry about the e8-a4 diagonal. However, the trade-off for White is
reducing the central tension and opening the c-file, which Black usually can
find useful. } 6. Nc3 e6 { White scores a remarkable 68 percent after this move,
according to the database. It's remarkable because it doesn't seem warranted
with the solidity of Black's position. } 7. Qa4+ { taking advantage of the open
diagonal to harass Black. } 7... Nbd7 ( 7... Nc6 $6 { lets White pile up the pressure
and has not been played in the database. } 8. Ne5 Rc8 9. Bb5 Qb6 { and now 10.
f3!? or 10. b3 look good for White, who can play comfortably on either the
kingside or queenside. } ) 8. Ne5 { the difference here from the previous
variation is that while the knight on d7 is still pinned, it is amply defended. } 8... a6 { a prophylactic move to take away the b5 square from White's bishop (or
knight). } 9. f3 $5 { only played once before in the database (a White loss),
but Komodo has it near the top of its choices. } ( 9. Nxg4 { is a more standard
choice, with a knight for bishop exchange. } 9... Nxg4 $11 { however, this takes the
pressure off Black. } ) 9... Bf5 10. g4 { the (only) logical follow-up to White's
previous move. The kingside space advantage is real, but Black need not panic.
However, it requires careful assessment and calculation to select the (only)
reply that keeps the balance. } 10... Bg6 $6 { this obvious move allows White to
benefit from his space advantage and keep pressing. } ( 10... b5 { counterattacks
immediately, to good effect: } 11. Qd1 { shifting the queen toward the kingside
action } 11... Nxe5 { another counterattack } 12. dxe5 Nxg4 { definitely not an obvious
move } 13. fxg4 Qh4+ 14. Kd2 Bxg4 15. Qe1 Qg5 { and the engine assesses that
Black has full compensation in an equal position. It is certainly more fun to
play the Black side here. } ) 11. h4 $16 b5 { still the best idea, but one move
too late to preserve Black's game. This is a common phenomenon found in
analyzing my own games, as well. } 12. Qd1 b4 { Black must keep up his
counterplay on the queenside, as White is much better equipped to play on the
kingside. } 13. h5 { Shankland correctly presses his own plan and ignores
Black's threat. } 13... Bxh5 { with nowhere else to go, the bishop's best move is to
kamikaze while the Nc3 remains under threat. } ( 13... bxc3 14. hxg6 Nxe5 15. dxe5 Nd7 16. gxh7 $16 ) 14. Nxd7 { this looks like the easier way for White to
proceed, eliminating the idea of ...Nxe5. The engine instead suggests moving
the Nc3 out of harm's way first, for example: } ( 14. Ne2 { preparing for a
kingside transfer } 14... Bg6 { now Black seems to have gotten away with taking the
h-pawn, but... } 15. Nxg6 fxg6 { forced, due to the pin on the Rh8 } 16. Nf4 Kf7 { to protect the g6 pawn, again because of the pin } 17. e4 $16 { and White has
more than enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn, with Black's king in an
awkward position. } ) 14... Nxd7 15. Rxh5 { choosing to have the semi-open h-file
and an active rook. } ( 15. Nxd5 { would mirror the bishop's kamikaze efforts;
Black could then continue with the same tactical motif: } 15... Bxg4 16. Nf4 g5 17. fxg4 gxf4 18. Qf3 fxe3 19. Bxe3 $14 { and Black keeps the extra pawn, but White
has compensation with better development and (probably) king safety. } ) 15... bxc3 16. bxc3 Qc7 { targeting the backward c-pawn. } 17. Bd2 { although White has
the two bishops, this doesn't seem to be an advantage here, as their scope is
currently limited. } 17... Bd6 18. Bd3 Nb6 { eyeing the c4 square. } 19. Ke2 { clearing
the first rank for White's heavy pieces and getting off the h4-e1 diagonal. } 19... h6 { this turns out to be rather loosening of Black's kingside and to give White
an easy target, although technically speaking it is not a bad move. Other good
options: } ( 19... Rb8 ) ( 19... g6 ) 20. g5 { Black still has the problem of the
pin on the Rh8. } 20... Kd7 { connecting the rooks and eliminating the pin problem. } 21. gxh6 gxh6 { Black's h-pawn is now passed, but also a middlegame target. } 22. Rb1 Rag8 { it's always difficult to select from different plausible-looking
placements of a rook. Perhaps Black had the intent of provoking White's next
move. } ( 22... Rab8 $5 ) 23. Bxa6 $2 { Shankland must have not seen a way for
Black's resulting attack to bear fruit here. } ( 23. f4 { is preferred by the
engine, which would block the Black dark-square bishop and also better prepare
the capture on a6. } ) 23... Rg2+ $19 24. Kd3 ( 24. Kf1 Rhg8 25. Rh1 ) 24... Ra8 { switching to offense along the a-file. } 25. Bb5+ Kd8 26. Rxh6 Rxa2 { White
remains a pawn up but his king is in an awful position and Black's rooks on
the second rank are strongly placed. } 27. Rh8+ Ke7 28. Re8+ Kf6 { White is now
out of threats. } 29. Be1 Kg7 { stopping ideas like Bh4, but } ( 29... Bg3 $5 { would get the Black bishop into the attack and remove a key White defender.
This looks like the simplest way to proceed. } ) 30. f4 { blocking out the Black
bishop. } 30... f5 ( 30... Nc4 $5 { would (again) bring another piece into the attack,
with strong threats. } ) 31. Qb3 { Black is still winning here, but has yet to
make a knockout move. White meanwhile is doing his best to contain Black's
threats and generate some of his own, making winning continuations less
obvious to find. The text move for example now makes the e6 pawn vulnerable. } ( 31. Rxe6 $4 Qc4+ 32. Bxc4 dxc4# ) 31... Qf7 { protecting the e-pawn, but now
removing the sacrificial tactic on c4. } ( 31... Rh2 { is a subtle continuation,
seizing the h-file and setting up the threat of ...Ra3 with a deflection
tactic, for example: } 32. Rxe6 Ra3 { and now } 33. Qxa3 $4 { runs into the same
mating sacrifice on c4 as in the above variation. } ) ( 31... Bxf4 { is a
not-so-subtle way to proceed and win, shattering the pawns around White's king: } 32. exf4 Qxf4 33. Re7+ Kf6 $19 { with a mate in eight, according to Komodo. } ) 32. Qd1 Nc4 33. Rd8 $1 { according to the ChessBase article, Sethuraman only

to resolve. } 33... Be7 $6 { the obvious move, which however gives White a lot of
breathing room. } ( 33... Nxe3 { is flagged by the engine as best, again with the

White the ability to get back to equality, with the following move. } ( 34... Nb2+ { is probably the simplest line, forcing the win of an exchange. } 35.

example after } 38. Qh5+ Kg7 { wins handily, as the Bh4 cannot be captured due
to the mate on d2. Calculating all this in time trouble would be difficult if
not impossible, though. } ) 35. Bxc4 dxc4+ 36. Kxc4 Qe8 ( 36... e5+ $5 ) 37. Rxb2 Rxb2 38. Qa1 Rb8 { again, what looks like an obvious harmless move turns out to

as the Bg7 is now a monster on the long diagonal and White has no real threats. } 13. Bc4 Qd8 { the best way of maintaining the tension in the center, not
afraid of the following sequence. } 14. Nxb7 Bxb7 15. Qb5 O-O { a cold-bloodedly
correct move. } 16. Qxb7 Ndb4 { eyeing the c2 square and restricting the White
queen. } 17. Qb5 Rb8 18. Qa4 Ne5 { for the cost of the sacrificed b-pawn, Black
has far more piece activity, while for White the Bc1 and Ra1 are not playing. } 19. Be2 { this is too passive. } ( 19. d3 $5 { would give back material in order
to get the Bc1 and Rf1 into the game. } 19... Nbxd3 20. Rd1 Nxc4 21. Qxc4 Ne5 $15 ) 19... Ned3 $17 ( 19... Nbd3 $5 { also looks good. } ) 20. Nf3 { it is remarkable to
compare this position with the one on move 11, as all of White's pieces have
retreated while Black's have advanced, and now White is behind in development. } 20... e5 { Black has an excellent position, but it's not clear exactly what plan is
best. Dominating the c-file looks good, while taking the b2 pawn at this point
does not. In the game, Goryachkina with this move chose to occupy the enter
with the e-pawn. She must have also calculated the next sequence as part of it,
perhaps even playing the text move to encourage her opponent to challenge the
Nb4. } ( 20... Rc8 $5 ) ( 20... Nxb2 $6 21. Bxb2 Bxb2 22. Rab1 Nd5 23. Qxa7 $11 ) 21. a3 $6 { White must have been feeling a little desperate by this point. } ( 21. Bxd3 { would have helped White gain some maneuvering room and eliminated one of
the two forward-deployed knights, at the cost of a pawn. } 21... Nxd3 22. Ne1 Nxb2 $15 ) 21... Nf4 { a forced move for Black in response, creating a counter-threat
against the Be2 while the Nb4 is hanging. } 22. Bd1 Nbd3 { now the Nb4 has a
place to go and Black is even more dominant. White has no good moves available,
although the engine suggests Ne1 as the best defense. } 23. g3 Nc5 { a "good
enough" type of move that preserves Black's advantage. } ( 23... e4 { is what the
engine prefers. It would take advantage of the e-pawn's position and launch a
decisive attack. For example } 24. gxf4 exf3 25. Bxf3 Re8 { and the f-pawn will
eventually fall while Black remains dominant positionally. However, this
requires a number of moves to fully unfold and in practical terms it does not
look easy to clearly evaluate the situation at the board. } ) 24. Qc4 Nfd3 25. Bc2 e4 $1 $19 { now the pawn advances to good effect, sacrificing itself to
achieve Black's complete piece dominance. } 26. Bxd3 Nxd3 27. Qxe4 Re8 28. Qa4 { this immediately lets Black's queen into d5, but White has severe problems in
any case. } ( 28. Qc4 Rc8 29. Qb3 Re4 { and now the rook can transfer to the
c-file and pressure the trapped Bc1. } ) 28... Qd5 29. Nh4 ( 29. Kg2 Re1 $19 ) ( 29. Qd1 Bxb2 30. Bxb2 Nxb2 31. Qc2 Rec8 32. Qb1 Qxf3 $19 ) 29... Nxf2 { and Black

1. c4 b6 2. Nf3 Bb7 3. Nc3 e6 4. g3 f5 { transposing to a Dutch Defense
structure with an accelerated queenside fianchetto. } 5. d3 { this keeps things
in English Opening territory, instead of transposing to a full Dutch by
playing d4. The main difference is that White controls e4 with a pawn, but
gives up influence over e5 and c5. } 5... Nf6 6. Bg2 Bb4 { continuing to pursue
hybrid/modern ideas in the Dutch. Here I don't believe that the bishop sortie
to b4 has much bite. The usual idea (with a White pawn on d4) is to increase
Black's control of e4 by pinning or exchanging the Nc3. } 7. O-O O-O 8. Bd2 $14 { I thought for a while here about the best placement of the bishop and whether
I should immediately play a3. I decided that in the event of a bishop for
knight exchange on c3, I would like to have the bishop on the long diagonal.
Of course there was no guarantee this would happen, but it turned out to be a
big factor in the game. The engine also considers White to have a small plus
by this point, I would say largely due to the misplacement of the Bb4, which
will either have to retreat or be exchanged favorably for White. } 8... d6 { now
there's no going back for the Bb4. } 9. a3 Bxc3 10. Bxc3 { a beautiful long
diagonal for the bishop, which will influence the course of the rest of the
game. } 10... Qe8 { a standard Dutch move, indicating support along the e-file for an
eventual ...e5 push, along with placing the queen on the e8-h5 diagonal with a
possible kingside transfer. } 11. b4 { in part this was a waiting move, but I
also wanted to seize some extra queenside space and contest c5. } 11... Nbd7 { getting
my opponent's last piece developed and supporting either ...c5 or ...e5.
Around here I had mentally noted that pushing ...e5 would not work tactically,
as can be seen shortly in the game. } 12. Qb3 { I considered this another good
point of playing b4, the ability to follow up by developing the queen to the
a2-g8 diagonal. However Black can now in fact play ...e5, as shown by the
engine, although it looks counterintuitive to open the diagonal in response. } ( 12. Re1 { immediately is better, setting up the tactic to follow if ...e5 is
pushed. } ) 12... Kh8 { moving the king off the diagonal to take away potential
tactical ideas involving a discovered attack following c4-c5. However, this
also puts the king in the corner, gives it fewer escape squares, and creates
tactics for White involving the pin of the g7-pawn. } ( 12... e5 { and now the
strong e/f pawn duo more than offset the weakness on the a2-g8 diagonal.
Unfortunately for White the immediate capture on e5 does not work tactically,
due to the presence of the rook on f1: } 13. Nxe5 $6 Bxg2 14. Nxd7 Bxf1 15. Nxf6+ gxf6 16. Rxf1 $11 ) 13. Rfe1 { played for tactical reasons in anticipation
of Black's next move, but also for strategic reasons, in the event of the
e-fiile being opened with a pawn exchange. } 13... e5 $2 { Black's key error of the
game. My opponent evidently was playing a standard plan by rote, without
checking the tactics first. Indeed, normally successfully playing ...e5 in the
Dutch is a very good thing. } 14. Nxe5 { this tactic works due to the fact that
Black's Bb7 is hanging and that I have a kamikaze target for the Ne5. } 14... Bxg2 15. Nxd7 Nxd7 16. Kxg2 $16 { I'm now a pawn up with no real compensation for my
opponent. He does get some initiative on the kingside in return, but neglects
to consider in turn my threats against Black's king. } 16... f4 17. Qb2 { pressure on
the long diagonal, in various forms, plays a critical role from here to the
end of the game. } 17... Qf7 { doubling the f-file pressure, but with an important
caveat, that the queen also must protect g7. } 18. f3 { solid, but not best. } ( 18. gxf4 $1 { would be the best way to exploit the queen having to cover g7. } 18... Nf6 19. Kh1 $18 ) 18... fxg3 19. hxg3 Rae8 20. Rh1 { I spent a while here making
sure that this move would not compromise my defense. Black's previous sequence,
by forcing the exchange of pawns, has now created some major potential threats
for me down the half-open h-file. } 20... Ne5 21. Raf1 { preventing a sacrifice on f3
and also opposing the rook (which is adequately protected) to the Qf7. } ( 21. f4 $5 { is another alternative that looks a little easier to play for White,
perhaps. } ) 21... Qe7 22. Rh4 { an important rook lift idea, with a transfer to
e4 being the main point of it. } 22... Ng6 23. Re4 $18 Qf7 { the queen remains
tethered to protecting g7. } 24. Rxe8 { I also spent a while thinking about this
move, finding nothing else that worked from an attacking standpoint. Reducing
material (and Black's attacking chances) seemed to be a principled
continuation. } 24... Rxe8 25. e4 { this seals the e-file against further threats and
allows the transfer of the queen along the second rank. The f-pawn is no
longer seriously threatened. } 25... Re6 { this represents a loss of valuable time for
Black, because of my next move. I presume he was thinking of transferring it
to the h-file after moving the Ng6, but this never happens. } 26. f4 { this
seemed to surprise my opponent. Perhaps advancing the pawns in front of the
king looks like it loosens the position, but the e4/f4 pawn duo is well
supported and controls keys squares. Now f5 is threatened with the fork, but
more importantly the Ng6 can no longer go to e5 and block the long diagonal. } 26... Re7 27. Qe2 { placing it on the d1-h5 diagonal for transfer to the kingside. I
checked the tactics carefully on this, given that the queen faces the Re7. } 27... c6 { to better support a ...d5 advance. } 28. Qg4 { showing some patience in
preparing the h-file attack. This also threatened penetration of Black's
position on the c8-h3 diagonal. } 28... Re8 { it's interesting to see how Black has
used up tempi with this rook while I am able to do more useful things with my
time, in setting up an attack on Black's king. } 29. Rh1 b5 $2 { too slow,
underestimating White's threats against the king. Now material loss is
inevitable along with ruining Black's position. } ( 29... Kg8 { would better
defend, but after } 30. Qh5 h6 31. a4 $18 { now White can support progress with
the e/f or the a/b pawns without Black being able to do much about it, leading
to a winning endgame. } ) 30. Qh5 { and now ...h6 is not possible due to the
position of the Kh8 and pin on the g7 pawn. } 30... Kg8 31. Qxh7+ Kf8 32. Rh5 { another rook lift theme; this took me a while to find. } 32... Ne7 33. Rg5 1-0

1. Nf3 Nf6 { I like to keep my options open when my opponent opens this way, in
part because I assume they have a lot more depth of experience on the
positions arising from more commital moves such as 1...d5. } 2. c4 c6 { supporting the ...d5 advance and indicating that I intend to enter a Slav-type
structure. } 3. b3 { this was a surprise, as normally players who like flank
openings get to the queenside fianchetto quicker, advancing the b-pawn on
either the first or second moves. } 3... d5 { my opening plan does not change,
however. } 4. Bb2 Bf5 { this is the most played in the position, according to
the database, and is the classical treatment of the Slav setup, but placing
the bishop on g4 is also popular and more of the modern approach. } 5. d3 e6 6. Nbd2 { done to avoid blocking the Bb2 on the long diagonal. } 6... Nbd7 7. g3 { providing the only viable outlet for the bishop. } 7... Be7 { not a bad move, but an
unimaginative placement of the bishop. } ( 7... Bc5 $5 ) 8. Bg2 O-O 9. O-O Re8 { done with the intention of potentially supporting an e-pawn advance, although
this never happens. It's unclear if it's a waste of a tempo. } ( 9... h6 { is a better "waiting" type move, as it accomplishes more by covering the g5
square and providing a potential retreat on h7 for the Bf5. } ) 10. a3 a5 11. d4 { this is antipositional, as it shuts in the Bb2. It also immediately gives
Black control of the e4 square, which I move to occupy. } 11... Ne4 { taking the
opportunity to centralize the knight. } 12. c5 { with the idea of gaining space
for White. Here I miss a good chance to attack and break up White's formation. } 12... Nxd2 13. Qxd2 Nf6 { originally I had thought that the exchange of minor pieces
helped me get this knight into play on f6; the position is fully equal.
However, there was a better approach. } ( 13... b6 14. b4 Qc7 { and Black will be
able to play ...Reb8 shortly, perhaps after taking on c5, with pressure on the
queenside. } 15. cxb6 $6 { for example does not work out well for White. } 15... Nxb6 { and now c4 will be a beautiful outpost for the knight, also shielding the
c-pawn from any pressure down the file. } ) 14. Qd1 Ne4 15. e3 Bg4 { again taking
advantage of a White pawn advance, this time to pin the Nf3. } 16. Qd3 Bxf3 { here I took because I thought not doing so would be a waste of time, plus I
had the next move in mind as a follow-up, so did not think White's
light-square bishop would be very "good". } ( 16... Bf5 { preserving the bishop
was probably better, since it has good prospects on the a7-b1 diagonal and I
could always exchange a knight on e5 with my other bishop. } ) 17. Bxf3 f5 { and we have now reached a Stonewall type position for Black. The Be7 would be
better placed on the h2-b8 diagonal, however. } 18. Qd1 Rf8 { here Komodo thinks
it is much better to play on the queenside, for example with ...b6, followed
by ...Rb8. This would help activate the Be7 and the rooks, among other things. } 19. Bg2 Qe8 { the queen actually isn't better on this diagonal. } ( 19... g5 $5 { if I'm going to play for a kingside Stonewall attack, better to go all in
soonest. } ) 20. Qe1 g5 21. Bc1 ( 21. f3 $5 ) 21... Qg6 { trying to get the queen
into the action, but this is rather awkward, as it doesn't really do anything
on either the g-file or the a7-b1 diagonal that's very helpful. } ( 21... g4 { would anticipate the f-pawn advance and neutralize it. } 22. f3 Ng5 { and now
Black can either exchange favorably on f3 or return to e4 if the f-pawn is
pushed. } ) 22. Bd2 h5 { I choose to ignore the threat to the a-pawn in favor of
advancing what I thought would be a decisive attack. I was over-optimistic,
however. } ( 22... Bd8 { however is a fine defensive move, giving up nothing in
terms of the bishop's action. } ) ( 22... e5 $5 { is also an interesting idea and
a thematic one in the Dutch, undermining White's central pawn structure. } 23. dxe5 Nxc5 ) 23. Bxe4 dxe4 { these types of pawn recapture decisions can be tough,
as it's not clear which one is best. } ( 23... fxe4 { is preferred by the engine. } 24. Bxa5 Rf7 25. a4 Qf5 { and Black has full compensation for the pawn, given
the pressure down the f-file, the threat of the queen penetrating on the
kingside, and the threat of the h-pawn advance. } ) 24. Bxa5 Rf7 25. Bd2 Raf8 26. Qe2 Rh7 $6 { I thought for a long time here and could not come to a definite
conclusion as to the best way to continue the attack. This was definitely not
the way, however. The rook was better placed on f7 to support the attack. } ( 26... f4 { with Black's pieces in place, no better time to force the issue. } 27. gxf4 ( 27. exf4 gxf4 28. Kh1 fxg3 29. fxg3 Rxf1+ 30. Rxf1 Rxf1+ 31. Qxf1 e3 $1 $15 ) 27... gxf4+ 28. Kh1 f3 29. Rg1 fxe2 30. Rxg6+ Kh7 31. Rag1 $11 ) 27. h3 { my opponent erred here by continuing to play on the kingside. With an extra
queenside pawn, the best strategy would be to mobilize it, if I insist on
taking longer than necessary to press things on the kingside. } ( 27. a4 $16 { and now for example } 27... h4 28. a5 g4 29. a6 bxa6 30. Rxa6 { and Black has to
defend the c-pawn or let the White pawns roll through unimpeded. } ) 27... h4 28. g4 Rhf7 { admitting that the rook move to h7 was a waste of time. } 29. f3 $6 { unnecessarily giving me another target. } 29... exf3 ( 29... fxg4 30. fxg4 Rf3 $1 $15 { is the idea the engine finds, which I did not. Not a decisive blow, but still
quite good for Black. } ) 30. Rxf3 fxg4 31. Rxf7 Qxf7 $15 32. hxg4 ( 32. Rf1 $2 Qxf1+ 33. Qxf1 Rxf1+ 34. Kxf1 gxh3 $19 ) ( 32. Qxg4 $15 ) 32... Qf3 { here I
started to despair a bit, my attack having failed to produce a decisive
breakthrough. This was completely unnecessary, however. The text move is OK,
but there are better - albeit more subtle - alternatives. } ( 32... e5 $15 { is one good idea, thematically breaking up White's central pawn chain. } ) ( 32... Qh7 { is another maneuver, with the idea of maneuvering with the queen to get a
more favorable position. For example } 33. e4 e5 34. Qc4+ Qf7 35. Qxf7+ Rxf7 $17 { and White's position in the center is undermined. } ) 33. Qg2 h3 { a good move,
but again I was thinking with more desperation - unnecessarily - than
objectivity. My brain was also rather tired by this point after a lot of
calculating. } 34. Qxf3 Rxf3 35. Rf1 $2 Rg3+ { this is a good move, but there's
a much better one... } ( 35... h2+ $1 { wins with a deflection tactic, as the
king is overloaded trying to protect both the Rf1 and the h1 queening square.
I was experiencing tunnel vision, however, and didn't even consider the pawn
move. Another example of the importance of CCT in the thinking process. } ) 36. Kh1 Rxg4 37. Rg1 Rxg1+ 38. Kxg1 Bd8 { this turns out to be a wasted tempo. } ( 38... e5 $1 { is the idea that I continued to fail to find. It would be winning
here. } ) 39. e4 { now ...Bc7 won't work, due to e4-e5...or so I thought. I'd
stopped thinking properly by this point, failing to consider my opponent's
responses. } 39... g4 40. Kh2 $2 Bh4 ( 40... Bc7+ $1 41. e5 Kg7 { and now the king
marches to e4 and victory. } ) 41. Bf4 Kf7 42. b4 Bf2 43. Be5 Kg6 $11 44. a4 Kg5 $2 ( 44... Kf7 ) 45. b5 { my opponent finds the right idea, mobilizing his
queenside majority, but in the end fails to follow through, due to his concern
about my kingside play. } 45... Kh4 46. Bf6+ Kh5 47. Be5 1/2-1/2

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 c5 3. Nf3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O { in the Symmetrical
English, White can essentially rattle off the previous sequence of moves
regardless of Black's setup, as long as there are no direct challenges in the
center (such as with ..d5). } 6... Nc6 7. d3 d6 { continuing the symmetry, an easy if
unchallenging approach in the center. } 8. Bd2 { this is somewhat committal in
terms of developing the bishop, although it was hard for me to see a better
square for it at this point. } ( 8. Rb1 ) 8... a6 9. Qc1 { the point of the
previous move is that it gives White the opportunity to try and exchange the
Bg7. } 9... Re8 { Black decides to prevent the exchange. } 10. Bh6 Bh8 11. a3 { taking
the b4 square away from the Nc6 and helping prepare an eventual b-pawn advance. } 11... Rb8 12. Rb1 { this preparatory move is usually played earlier, but is fine
now. I don't handle Black's next well, however. } 12... b5 13. Nd2 { this gives Black
a little too much leeway and leads to ceding the initiative. } ( 13. cxb5 { is the most logical response. } 13... axb5 14. b4 ) 13... Bd7 14. cxb5 { unfortunately
this is no longer a good capture for me. A good idea a move too late. } 14... axb5 15. Nde4 ( 15. b4 { as in the above variation is no longer possible. } 15... Ng4 { now gains
a tempo by taking advantage of the Bh6 now being "loose". For example } 16. Bf4 cxb4 17. axb4 Rc8 $17 { and now ...Nxb4 with a discovered double attack on the
Nc3 is a major threat. } ) 15... b4 16. Nxf6+ { the idea is to exchange off a
pair of knights and get some more room for my pieces. } 16... Bxf6 17. Nd5 Bg7 { I was happy to exchange off Black's powerful bishop on the long diagonal. } ( 17... Nd4 $5 $15 ) 18. Bxg7 Kxg7 19. Qd2 { connecting the rooks and further
pressuring b4. Black still has a positional advantage on the queenside, as his
pieces are working together better than mine (especially after the Nd5 is
kicked next move) and he has more space and a better pawn structure. } 19... e6 20. Ne3 Nd4 { eyeing the undefended b3 square as well as the e2 pawn. A concrete
demonstration of Black's advantage in space. } 21. axb4 { at the time I thought
this was a major error, as Black ends up with a lot of pressure down the
b-fiile and wins a pawn. The engine doesn't find anything much better for
White, however. } ( 21. Nc2 Nb3 22. Qe1 bxa3 23. bxa3 Qa5 24. Qxa5 Nxa5 $17 { with superior play for Black against the isolated a-pawn. } ) 21... Rxb4 22. Nc2 { I felt that this was essentially forced, otherwise the Nd4 dominates. } ( 22. Ra1 ) 22... Nxc2 23. Qxc2 Qb6 { now it becomes obvious that the b-pawn is doomed. } 24. Qc3+ Kg8 25.

Black's queenside pressure. The queen threatens to penetrate on the 7th rank
if the Re8 departs. } 25... Bc6 $6 ( 25... e5 $17 { was the move I was most concerned
about, which would break the connection to b2 on the long diagonal. } ) 26. h4 { still focusing on the kingside counterplay - somewhat out of desperation -
rather than looking to shore up the queenside defense, which was possible here. } ( 26. Bxc6 Qxc6 27. Ra1 Qb7 28. Rfb1 $15 ) 26... Bxg2 27. Kxg2 { I didn't mind
the exchange on g2, since it would potentially allow a rook to go to h1
quicker. } 27... Qb7+ 28. f3 h5 { blocking the threat of h4-h5. } 29. e4 { the point of
this was then to threaten the g4 advance; without the pawn on e4, the f3 pawn
would be pinned and could not retake in the event of an exchange. } 29... Qe7 30. Qxe7 { here I offered a draw. Without the queens on, Black has no further prospect
of a forced breakthrough on the b-file, although he certainly has an endgame
advantage with space, pawn structure, and rook activity. My opponent thought
for a while and accepted after taking the queen, his lack of time on the clock
being the deciding factor. } 30... Rxe7 1/2-1/2

is rare, but scores well in the database. It is a little loose compared with
the main line continuation. } ( 12... Be7 ) 13. Rde1 Be7 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4 cxd4 16. Nxd4 Nc5 { attacking the Qe4 and covering b7. I had contemplated
sacrificing the b-pawn and playing ...Nf6, but I didn't see enough of an
advantage in it, even with the extra file available to attack White's king. } ( 16... O-O { would be the way to offer the b-pawn and also looks best, getting
the king to safety. For example } 17. Qxb7 $2 Nc5 { and now the Qb7 is attacked
and the Nd4 cannot be protected. } ) ( 16... Nf6 { is indeed unsound, according to
Komodo, where Black is evaluated as having little or no compensation. } 17. Qxb7 Rb8 18. Qc6+ $16 ) 17. Qg4 Bf6 { the bishop here has a very nice diagonal and
protects g7. } 18. Bc3 O-O $11 { as we head into the middlegame the position is
balanced. } 19. Rd1 Qb6 20. Ne2 { it was smart of my opponent to exchange the
bishops, since otherwise White has little hope for play on the kingside. } 20... Bxc3 21. Nxc3 { here the position calls for contesting the d-file, but I was
over-optimistic about generating queenside threats. } 21... a5 ( 21... Rad8 ) 22. f4 { removing the pawn from the g1-a7 diagonal where the Qb6 was eyeing it. Also a
good attacking idea with f4-f5. However, it does leave the e3 square
uncontrolled and available for the Black queen. } 22... a4 { not very creative and
ignoring the power of the queen. } ( 22... Qb4 $5 { with a side pin of the f4
pawn. } ) 23. f5 a3 { I had to think for a while on these last two moves, as
things are starting to heat up with the "race" on both sides. I correctly
calculate that the text move holds the balance and expected White's next. } 24. b3 Nxb3+ $2 { however, I now play this as the result of an over-optimistic
miscalculation. White plays the correct defensive line, which results in
Black's attack not having enough punch to compensate for the material. } ( 24... exf5 25. Qxf5 Rae8 $11 ) 25. cxb3 Rac8 26. Qf3 Qc5 27. Kc2 $16 { now my attack
is blunted and the best I can do is get another pawn for the piece, but I keep
trying, figuring that the material will be insufficient anyway. } 27... b5 28. Rh4 { a clever (and only) defensive move, as now ...b4 is met by Rc4. } 28... Qe5 { by this
point I'm really just hoping for a swindle, feeling that I've essentially lost. } ( 28... b4 { is probably still best, but after } 29. Rc4 Qa5 30. Ne2 exf5 31. Nd4 $16 { White is simply up material and it looks bleak for Black. } ) 29. Rhd4 $18 Qb8 { now with the threat of ...b4 winning the pinned Nc3, but my opponent
easily avoids it by removing the king from the pin. } 30. Kb1 b4 31. Ne4 Qe5 32. f6 { now my opponent seals the win quickly with a breakthrough on the kingside. } 32... Rc7 33. Qg4 g6 34. hxg6 fxg6 35. Qxg6+ 1-0

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. e3 c6 5. b3 Bb4 { this was a little surprising,
I felt that ...Bd6 would be more in keeping with Black's Semi-Slav type setup. } 6. Bb2 O-O 7. Qc2 Qd6 { this seemed like a premature development of the queen,
as well as restricting the Bb4's retreat squares. We are now out of the
database. } 8. a3 { the obvious reaction, inconveniencing the bishop. } 8... Ba5 9. b4 { continuing with the theme of pushing back Black's pieces and gaining space on
the queenside. Perhaps not most effective, however. The bishop on a5 is not
doing much and represents a waste of time for Black, while the new square it
goes to is more useful. } ( 9. d4 $5 { would get space in the center and make a
the follow-on Bd3 development logical. } ) 9... Bc7 10. c5 { this does nothing
for my development and leaves Black's d-pawn looking stronger. } ( 10. Be2 dxc4 11. Bxc4 $14 ) 10... Qe7 $11 11. Be2 { again, d4 is logical but would have the
disadvantage of shutting in the Bb2. } 11... b6 { challenging the pawn chain at its
top. } 12. cxb6 axb6 13. O-O Bb7 { Black continues with a rather slow
development plan. } 14. Rfd1 Nbd7 { although I felt that Black had not played
the opening particularly well, at this point his development is fine and a bit
better coordinated than mine. He is certainly better positioned in the center
for space. Komodo gives a slight edge to Black. } 15. d3 { in the expectation
that the following sequence would occur. } 15... e5 16. e4 d4 17. Nb1 c5 $6 { this
seems like an obvious move at the Class level, to advance and support the d4
pawn, but with Black having gained space and restricted my pieces, this just
allows me to get some breathing space on the queenside. } ( 17... b5 $5 { would
lock things up to Black's advantage. } ) 18. bxc5 $6 ( 18. Nbd2 { would help with
my neglected piece development. } ) 18... bxc5 { this is what I had expected. } ( 18... Nxc5 $1 { and now Black will dominate the queenside, likely winning the
a-pawn and causing major problems once his bishops get further into play from
d6 and c6. } ) 19. Nbd2 Bc6 { here I failed to ask the question in my thinking
process, what did my opponent's move change about the position? What new CCT
does he now have available? } 20. Nc4 $2 { this leads to an unintentional
exchange sacrifice. I spotted Black's skewer tactic immediately *after* moving.
I therefore played the next couple of moves rapidly and with confidence, since
there was nothing else to be done. } ( 20. Rdc1 ) ( 20. a4 ) 20... Ba4 $17 21. Qd2 Bxd1 22. Bxd1 { a key part of the sequence for White, capturing with the bishop
rather than the queen. The bishop will be repositioned to a much better square,
serving as partial compensation for the sacrifice. } 22... Nb6 { normally it's a good
idea to simplify with piece exchanges in order to magnify a material advantage,
and this was presumably my opponent's main idea here. However, this benefits
me by accelerating the activation of my light-square bishop. } ( 22... Rfb8 ) 23. Nxb6 Bxb6 24. Qg5 { I felt this was necessary to develop counterplay. The queen
has to be activated and has a relatively open field in front of the Black king.
The pin on the Nf6 will also lose Black some time. } 24... Rfe8 { unpinning the Nf6. } 25. Bb3 { While Black is still comfortably winning on objective measures, this
bishop now becomes a monster on the a2-g8 diagonal and its pinning of the f7
pawn will eventually be the decisive factor in the game. } 25... Bc7 { clearing the
b-file for one of Black's rooks and reinforcing e5. However, a Black rook
never ends up on the b-file. } 26. Bc4 { anticipating future possible pressure
down the b-file. } 26... Nd7 { offering a queen trade. } 27. Qh5 { naturally I avoid
trading queens and maintain some pressure on Black's kingside, adding h7 as a
target and attacking f7 again. Ng5 now becomes a potential threat. } 27... g6 $6 { unnecessarily weakening the squares in front of the Black king. } ( 27... Nf6 { is what I was expecting. } 28. Qg5 { and we try again with the position. } ) ( 27... Rf8 { is the engine's choice, but this sort of defensive move can be
psychologically hard to play, especially since the rook had just recently
moved away from f8. } ) 28. Qh6 Qf8 { this apparently was the idea behind the
previous move, but this ends up placing Black's queen on a much more awkward
square. } 29. Qh3 Nf6 { in contrast with the previous situation, now the Nf6 is
not protected. } 30. Bc1 $15 { bringing another piece around to exert pressure
and materially improving the evaluation for White, as previously the
dark-square bishop was locked out of the game. Part of my compensation for
being down an exchange is that I am able to use both bishops and the knight
effectively to attack the kingside, along with the queen, while Black has only
the queen and knight defending the kingside. } 30... h5 31. Bg5 $6 { wrong piece. The
bishop is doing fine on the c1-h6 diagonal where it is, while the knight could
do better on g5. Attacking the Nf6 is not much of a threat in reality,
although it does prompt my opponent to play an awkward follow-up move. } ( 31. Ng5 { would target f7 and increase the pressure. } 31... Re7 32. Qh4 $15 ) 31... Bd8 ( 31... Qd6 $17 { is much better, getting the queen to a more effective square. } ) 32. Qg3 { leaving the diagonal and shifting the queen's target to the now
underprotected e5 pawn. } 32... Nd7 $2 { missing the following tactic, one which I had
spotted as a possibility after 27...g6, based on the pin of the f7 pawn. I
believe my opponent was still focused on a general plan of trading down
material. } ( 32... Qd6 ) 33. Bxd8 $18 Raxd8 34. Qxg6+ Kh8 ( 34... Qg7 35. Bxf7+ Kf8 36. Bxe8 Rxe8 37. Qxh5 $18 ) 35. Qxh5+ Kg7 36. Qg4+ { I thought for a while
before making this move. I wanted to bring another piece (the Nf3) into the
attack by leaving the g5 square open for it. } 36... Kh8 37. Ng5 { now the combination
of mate threats plus the attack on f7 decide the game. } 37... Nb6 38. Qh5+ 1-0

seems like a bit of a waste of time in the opening, especially after the next
move. Presumably it was done to preserve the bishop from exchange. } 7... Na5 8. Be2 Nf6 { this looks like it makes the knight a target for an advance of the e-pawn,
but that would not turn out particularly well for White. } 9. Qe1 { at around 48
percent, this scores better than anything else for White in the database, but
it's still not a good thing. Black has fully equalized already while White
continues to lose time in the opening. } ( 9. e5 dxe5 10. Nxe5 ( 10. fxe5 $6 Ng4 $17 ) 10... O-O $11 { and Black has a comfortable game. } ) 9... Nc6 10. Bc4 { inviting a repetition of moves, although Black can do better. } 10... Nd4 ( 10... O-O $5 { the engine suggests castling first, which looks safer. } 11. d3 Nd4 ) 11. Qh4 $6 { this doesn't work and I'm not sure what White was looking to do here by
offering the c2 pawn as a sacrifice. Even simply castling in response is fine
for Black. } ( 11. Nxd4 { simplest appears best here. } 11... cxd4 12. e5 dxc3 13. exf6 Qb6+ 14. Rf2 Bxf6 $11 ) 11... b5 { an interesting idea that further complicates
the game and keeps the tension up, which is probably what Xiong wanted. } ( 11... Nxc2 12. Rb1 Nd4 $17 { and White doesn't have any real threats. For example } 13. Ng5 $2 ( 13. b3 $17 ) 13... d5 ( 13... e6 { is also sufficient } ) 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. f5 ( 15. Nxh7 $2 { the knight is pinned here and Black now has a free hand. } 15...

OK for Black, but gives White at least the appearance of some initiative. } ) 12. Nxd4 cxd4 13. Nxb5 Qb6 { Black has (temporarily) invested a pawn, but has the
initiative in return. } 14. a4 a6 15. a5 Qc6 16. Na3 Nxe4 { now Black has his
pawn back and a favorable position, while White's pieces are uncoordinated and
he lacks an obvious plan to make progress. } 17. d3 Nf6 18. Nb1 { an excellent
illustration of how time in the opening and early middlegame can be valuable.
The knight has journeyed back to its original square, with associated tempo
loss, while Black can now make progress in the center. } ( 18. Bb3 $5 $15 { would clear the c4 square for the knight instead. } ) 18... d5 19. Bb3 Qc5 { this avoids having White play Ba4. While d6 seems like a more useful square
for the queen, being less limited, Xiong no doubt had the next knight maneuver
to e3 in mind, which the queen supports. } 20. Re1 Ng4 21. Re2 Ne3 { Black would
be quite happy to have White capture the knight, thereby undoubling the Black
d-pawns and giving him a passed pawn on e3. } 22. h3 { another time-wasting move. } ( 22. Nd2 $5 { White really needs to get more of his pieces into the game. } ) 22... O-O { White now has no prospects on the kingside and it's about time to
get the king to safety away from the center. } 23. Qe1 Rab8 { activating the
rook; Black wants to play with all of his pieces. This may seem to ignore
White's last move, which adds pressure to the Ne3, but it still cannot be
taken without benefiting Black. } 24. Ra3 { again a move illustrating how
awkward White's position is. } ( 24. Bxe3 dxe3 { opening up the long diagonal and
the d4 square for the Bg7 } 25. Rxe3 $2 Bd4 $19 ) 24... Rfc8 $19 { by this point
White is under huge pressure, which will simply get worse, and can do nothing
about it. } 25. Kh1 { moving off of the g1-a7 diagonal and taking away the ...
Bd4 tactic, but it still doesn't help much. } 25... Bf5 26. Bxe3 dxe3 27. Rxe3 Bxb2 28. Ra2 Bd4 { Black can again safely ignore White's threat to pick up a pawn,
in this case on e7. } 29. Rf3 ( 29. Rxe7 Bf2 $1 { and now wherever the queen
moves, the Re7 will be left hanging, or White opens himself to back rank
problems. } ( 29... Bxd3 { would also be sufficient, as the Bb3 would be hanging
after a recapture on d3 } ) 30. Qe2 ( 30. Qd2 Rxb3 31. cxb3 Qxe7 32. Qxf2 Rc1+ ) 30... Rxb3 { winning the piece, as if } 31. cxb3 $2 Qc1+ $19 ) 29... h5 { stopping
g4 to kick the Bf5 } 30. Nd2 { White finally gets all of his pieces developed,
on move 30. } 30... Bc3 31. Qf2 e6 { an instructive decision. Black heads for the
endgame, which he must be confident of winning, as he will pick up the
indefensible a5 pawn in the process. } 32. Qxc5 Rxc5 { After the exchange of
queens Black wins the a-pawn and the game is practically over. } 33. Nf1 Rxa5 34. Rxa5 Bxa5 { Black has the outside passed a-pawn, the two bishops, and a
well-placed rook, which should (and do) lead him to victory from this point on. } 35. Kh2 Bc3 36. g3 a5 { passed pawns must be pushed! } 37. Ne3 { designed to
support the g-pawn advance } 37... Rb4 { Black can also just make a waiting move with
the bishop here, such as ...Bg7. This would remove White's subsequent threat
along the third rank with the rook, although it perhaps doesn't matter in the
end. } 38. g4 hxg4 39. hxg4 { Black can now play this several different ways.
The problem for White is that his bishop is trapped after ...a4 } 39... Bxd3 40. Ng2 a4 41. Bxa4 Be4 42. Rxc3 Rxa4 { Black is still winning comfortably after the
end of the sequence - remaining a pawn up, with a strong bishop vs. knight,
and one pawn island versus two. However, those of us with lesser endgame
technique might not have chosen this particular path. } 43. Ne1 Ra1 44. Re3 Rc1 { the ideal spot for the rook, behind White's isolated pawn. } 45.

variation, Black is significantly ahead with the d-pawn and his king position
in the center. Although the f-pawn will fall, this doesn't affect Black's
defense against the White pawns, as Black's king will penetrate. } 54. Kd2 Ke4 55. Nxf7 Kxf4 56. c3 d3 { White could simply resign at this point, but
apparently decides to play on in the hopes of a blunder by his opponent. } 57. Nd6 e5 58. Nc4 e4 { Black has two connected passed pawns in the center, will
grab the g5 pawn giving him a third passed pawn, and Black's bishop covers the
c8 queening square for White. } 59. Ne3 Kxg5 { a minor piece exchange is fine
for Black, since the White king can't cover all of the passed pawns. } 60. Ke1 Bg4 61. Nd5 Kf5 62. Kd2 Ke5 63. Ne7 g5 64. Ke3 Bf3 65. c4 g4 { passed pawns

more challenging than the other standard move developing the bishop to f5. } 5. d3 { continuing with the standard plan of the King's Indian Attack setup. White

engine recommendation, a waiting move that also restricts Black's king. } 30... Rac8 31. Qg4 Qxg4 32. Rxg4 Bd6 $15 ) 30... Qxc5 31. b4 Qf5 $17 { looking at how the
position has transformed, White's bishop is now largely locked away, although
may get back into the action via c7. Meanwhile Black's control of the e-file

the action. } 32. Rf2 Re4 33. Rg1 Rae8 34. Bc7 $2 { an apparently logical idea,
to increase pressure on the f-pawn and have the bishop do something useful,

principle of looking for tactical exchanges, in this case the f-pawn for the
h-pawn, since White could not take and also protect at the same time.

Black, due to White's vulnerable king. } 36. Kg2 Ne3+ 37. Qxe3 { forced. } 37... Qg4+ { here the value of the tactic of gaining a tempo is illustrated, with White's
queen moving out of danger. } 38. Qg3 Rxg3+ 39. Bxg3 Re3 40. Kh2 Qh5+ { a nice
little tactic to pick up the g-pawn and give Black a passed pawn on the
kingside. } 41. Kg2 Qxg5 { White does not have compensation for being down
material (R+B vs Q). It is instructive to see how Black's Q+R combination
holds the initiative and how White is essentially helpless to do anything from
this point forward. } 42. Kh2 Re6 43. Rgg2 Qh5+ 44. Kg1 Qd1+ 45. Rf1 Qd4+ 46. Rff2 Re1+ 47. Kh2 Qd1 48. Bf4 Qh5+ 49. Kg3 Rh1 50. Rh2 Rg1+ 51. Rhg2 Rh1 52. Rh2 Qg6+ 53. Kh3 Qe6+ 54. Kg3 Re1 55.

establishing a central pawn presence. } 6. O-O Nge7 { the idea here is not to
block the f-pawn's advance later. } 7. Ne1 { White's idea is to redeploy the
knight via c2. This is slow, but the opening is largely about maneuver rather
than attack. } 7... d6 8. Nc2 { from here the knight can support the b4 advance or
move to e3 to increase domination of the d5 square. } 8... h5 $5 { this move scores
well in the database - although see the next annotation - but is not often
played. There is only one game listed in 2015 with it, for example. } ( 8... Be6 { is the more conventional choice, along with castling. } ) 9. d3 { both Komodo
and the database indicate that the reaction h4 should be avoided. In the small
sample (19) of games available, it has been played roughly half of the time
and scores badly at 25 percent. That said, White appears to be OK in the line,
although it allows some additional attacking ideas for Black, as in the
following game: } ( 9. h4 g5 10. hxg5 h4 11. Ne3 hxg3 12. fxg3 Be6 13. Ncd5 Qd7 14. Nf6+ Bxf6 15. Rxf6 Rg8 16. Nd5 O-O-O 17. d3 Nf5 18. Rxf5 Bxf5 19. Nf6 Qc7 20. Qf1 Be6 21. Nxg8 Rxg8 22. Bd2 Nd4 23.

logical follow-up. If Black is going to advance the h-pawn, she should go all
in. } 10. Ne3 { most played here, although the engine evaluates that first
proceeding with standard play centered around the b-file is fine. } ( 10. a3 a5 11. Rb1 a4 12. Bg5 f6 13. Bd2 h3 14. Bh1 O-O 15. Ne3 { is one possibility. } ) 10... Be6 { this gets the bishop out, but Black did not need to develop it this
early, as it is doing fine on its original square for now. It does nothing to
impede White's next move. } 11. Ned5 f6 { this seems a little premature and
commital. } ( 11... h3 $5 { is the engine's choice, which would avoid White's
later gxh4. } ) 12. Qe1 { Yu here is signaling a shift in commitment to a
kingside strategy, placing her queen on the e1-h4 diagonal and preparing her
next move. } ( 12. Rb1 $5 { would continue with queenside and central play. } ) 12... Qd7 13. f4 O-O-O { Melekhina notes the strategic shift and castles on the
opposite wing, making White's threat of expansion on the kingside less urgent. } 14. fxe5 fxe5 $6 { this looks like a logical and "clean" move visually, but
immediately gives White some advantage to play with, including the open f-file
and the initiative. From here on out, the game gets wilder. } ( 14... Bxd5 $5 { with the idea of exchanging material and reducing potential White threats. } 15. Nxd5 Nxe5 16. gxh4 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 f5 $11 ) 15. gxh4 { ugly-looking but effective.
Black has some compensation for the pawn, due to the weak doubled h-pawns, but
White does an admirable job of covering the weaknesses and playing actively. } 15... Bh3 $2 { it turns out that Black needs to worry more about her white-square
weaknesses, especially on f7, with the absence of this bishop. White has a
number of ways to take advantage of this. } ( 15... Bxd5 { is still a good idea,
but leaves White in better shape compared with the above variation: } 16. Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 Nd4 18. Bg5 $14 ) 16. Bg5 ( 16. Rf7 $1 { and Black has some

for the pawn. } ) 18... Nf5 $11 { a good consolidating move by Black. With this
and the previous rook move, she has shut down threats along the f-file. White
can also no longer trade down material, as in the previous variation. } 19. Ne4 { centralizing the knight and recognizing that the e4 square is superior to b5
for it now. } 19... Bh6 $6 { continuing with the theme of moving bishops away from
controlling key squares, in this case f6. This time White takes advantage of
it better. } ( 19... Ncd4 ) 20. Nef6 $16 Qe6 21. e4 { White has regained the
initiative and revived the utility of the f-file. } 21... Nxh4+ { a piece sacrifice
based on an interesting tactical idea for Black. } ( 21... Nfd4 $16 { is the
safer choice. } ) 22. Bxh4 Bg5 $2 { unfortunately for Black, this bishop move
doesn't work. Yu spots the refutation, which is not obvious. Two white pieces
are hanging (the Bh4 and the Nf6) and the Bh4 can't move without allowing ...
Qxh3. However, White finds a creative solution by giving back the piece. } ( 22... Bf4 { is the only good continuation here, with the threat of ...g5 and ...

1. Nf3 { While this is often the first move of a Reti Opening, it's also a good
way to be noncommital at the start of the game. } 1... Nf6 { Black obviously thinks
the same way. } 2. c4 e6 { this is now technically an English Opening and is
classified as such, even though White eventually plays d4. } 3. b3 { an offbeat
but perfectly fine and successful (57 percent) opening approach. } 3... d5 { Black
decides to adopt a QGD structure, a solid approach. } 4. Bb2 Be7 5. e3 { the
double fianchetto with g3-Bg2 is also popular. } 5... O-O 6. d4 { Nakamura plays this
with the idea of subsequently developing the light-square bishop to d3, rather
than the more conventional e2. } 6... b6 { now Black is going for a QGD-Tartakower
formation by fianchettoing his light-square bishop. } 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. O-O c5 9. Nbd2 ( 9. Qe2 { is an interesting alternative, freeing up d1 for the rook and
forming a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal. } ) ( 9. Nc3 { used to be played more
often, but at top levels not so much recently. } ) 9... Nc6 10. Rc1 Rc8 { interestingly, up until this point Nakamura is following (intentionally or not)
a successful game of his opponent's (as White) from 2013. Now, as Black,
Harika varies from what her opponent did previously, but she still ends up
losing. } ( 10... cxd4 { is considered equal by the engine. } 11. exd4 Nh5 12. g3 g6 13. Qe2 Nf6 14. Rfd1 a5 15. a3 Re8 16. Nf1 Bf8 17. Ne3 Bh6 18. Ne5 dxc4 19. Bxc4 Qd6 $2 20. Bb5 Rac8 21.

(2475)-Khotenashvili,B (2514) Tashkent 2013 } ) 11. a3 { taking the b4 square
away from the Nc6. Nakamura has an equal position and appears not to want to
hurry with any major plans, but rather see in what direction his opponent
wishes to go. } 11... Re8 { following a similar plan as in the game cited above. } 12. Re1 Bf8 { this is a logical follow-up and presumably aimed at defending the
kingside, but the bishop is obviously less active than it could be elsewhere,
for example on d6. Unlike the above game cited with Harika as White, here she
never plays the freeing ...g6, which is necessary to activate the bishop. } 13. dxc5 bxc5 14. cxd5 exd5 15. Qc2 h6 ( 15... g6 { is possible here, and probably
preferable. It blunts the b1-h7 Q+B battery that White has established, while
giving the Bf8 an outlet. Perhaps Black did not like the looks of opening the
long diagonal to White's Bb2. } ) 16. Qb1 { this prudently removes the queen from
the c-file while preserving the battery on the diagonal. It also serves as
another waiting move for Nakamura, which works to his advantage. } ( 16. Bf5 { is a more conventional approach. } ) 16... Nd7 { this does not appear
strategically consistent with the idea of maintaining a strong kingside
defensive presence. } 17. Bh7+ Kh8 18. Bf5 { the advantage of this sequence,
beyond simply moving to f5 directly, is that Black's king is slightly more
vulnerable and her g-pawn is pinned, creating some tactical ideas for White. } 18... Rb8 { moving away so the Nd7 is freed from the pin on the diagonal. } 19. Qa1 { very hypermodern of Nakamura and an idea associated with the Reti Opening. The
queen in the corner exerts pressure on the center and against Black's king. } 19... Qe7 $6 { one gets the impression that Black did not know how to proceed in this
type of position. White now immediately takes advantage of this slip. } 20. b4 { threatening to continue with b5, which would be very awkward for the Nc6.
Again the idea is to dominate the center through indirect means, in this case
chasing away a piece defending e5. } 20... cxb4 21. axb4 a6 { the logical follow-up,
preventing b5. However, now White has other useful things he can do. } 22. Nb3 { the exchanges have given White a potential strong outpost on c5. Black's
d-pawn is also now isolated and White has the square in front of it (d4)
blockaded, making the pawn weak. } 22... Nde5 ( 22... Nb6 $5 { would more directly
address Black's d-pawn weakness. } ) 23. Nxe5 Nxe5 24. Nc5 { after the piece
exchange White's position is improved, with the strong c5 outpost occupied;
note also how Black's Bf8 is doing nothing constructive. Here perhaps Nakamura
expected the symmetrical ...Nc4 from Black, occupying her own outpost and
cutting off the c-file. However, Harika goes wrong with her next move. } 24... Nf3+ $2 { this sacrifice must be either the result of miscalculation or desperation on
Black's part. } 25. gxf3 Qg5+ 26. Bg4 h5 27. Nxb7 Rxb7 28. Qxa6 { the key move
from White's perspective. Black must lose a tempo due to the threat and White
can simplify into a favorable position after making some counterthreats. } 28... hxg4 ( 28... Rxb4 29. Bc3 Rc4 30. h4 Qxh4 31. Bd7 Rd8 32. Bb5 $18 ) 29. f4 { another
key move for White, keeping the tension of multiple threats. } ( 29. Qxb7 $4 gxf3+ 30. Kf1 Qg2# ) 29... Qe7 $18 { so White emerges from the sequence with an
extra (passed) pawn and a winning game. } 30. b5 { passed pawns must be pushed! } 30... Qd7 31. b6 Bb4 32. Red1 Re6 33. Bd4 { note again how Black's dark-square bishop
is not doing anything constructive and how its White counterpart is helping
dominate the game. } 33... Rh6 $2 { this attempt to generate some threats on the
h-file in fact leads to quick victory for White, as the rook partially blocks
an outlet for the cornered Kh8. } ( 33... Bd6 { would allow resistance for a
while longer. } ) 34. Qa8+ Kh7 35. Rc8 Kg6 36. Rg8 Rh7 37. Qc8 { almost anything
wins at this point. A queen exchange would lead to an easy (for a GM) endgame
win, so Nakamura does not mind that possibility. } 37... Qe7 { this leads to a quicker,
merciful end. } ( 37... Qxc8 38. Rxc8 Ba5 39. Ra1 Bxb6 40. Ra6 f6 41. Rxb6 Rxb6 42. Bxb6 $18 { the extra bishop and Black's doomed d-pawn ensure a White

1. d4 f5 { Nakamura is one of the few top GMs who uses the Dutch on a regular
basis. He's currently the world number 2, so it seems to be working for him. } 2. Bg5 { like with the Trompowsky Opening after Black plays 1...d5, this early
Bishop sortie can be unexpected and highly annoying. } 2... c6 { this is only the
fourth most popular move (...g6 being the primary choice in the database), but
scores the best for Black (45 percent). } 3. e3 Qb6 { this is the idea behind
the previous move. Since White has developed his bishop early, Black will seek
to take advantage of its absence on the queenside. This is also analagous to
other "poison pawn" variations (such as in the Najdorf Sicilian) involving
taking the b-pawn with the queen. } 4. Nd2 { this scores much better in the
database than the cautious defensive move b3. Here's a sample of how Black
could play in that variation: } ( 4. b3 g6 5. Bd3 Bg7 6. Nd2 h6 7. Bf4 d6 8. c3 Nf6 9. Ne2 O-O 10. Qc2 Nbd7 11. Bc4+ Kh7 12. Be6 c5 13. h4 cxd4 14. exd4 Nh5 15. Nf3 Ndf6 16. Bc4 e5 17.

Qxb2 { following up by taking the offered pawn, otherwise the early queen move
doesn't make much sense. } 5. Rb1 ( 5. Bd3 { is the other popular way to play. !? } ) 5... Qc3 6. g4 { a novelty that is obviously very aggressive. Apparently no
one else has tried it in international play since this game. } ( 6. Ne2 ) ( 6. Bd3 ) 6... Qa5 { unconventional play from Nakamura, for which he is well known. I
suspect he was being deliberately provocative with his lower-rated opponent. } ( 6... fxg4 { is the engine recommendation. Of course the computer has no fear of
the consequences to Black's kingside and considers the position level. } 7. Qxg4 { does appear premature ?! } ( 7. Rb3 Qa5 8. Qxg4 { is an improved version of the
idea for White. } ) 7... Qxc2 8. Ngf3 Nf6 9. Qh4 d6 { now White does not seem to
have any way of breaking through to Black's king and therefore does not have
enough compensation for the pawns. ⩱ } ) ( 6... d6 { is another, somewhat more
conventional option. !? } 7. gxf5 Bxf5 8. Rxb7 Qxc2 { and Black should be OK. } ) 7. gxf5 Qxf5 8. h4 ( 8. Ngf3 { !? has the advantage of developing a piece while
protecting the Bg5. } ) 8... Qa5 { at this point Black's only developed piece is
his queen, but he has the extra pawn and is threatening the a-pawn. Meanwhile,
White is ahead on development but has a weaker pawn structure overall as well.
The position in any case is quite imbalanced, probably what Nakamura was going
for. } 9. Nh3 { this leaves f3 open for the queen, but is a bit awkward
development of the knight, even if it can go to f4. } 9... g6 { another provocative,
apparently weakening move. } ( 9... Nf6 { seems perfectly fine here. } 10. Nf4 Ne4 11. Bd3 Qxd2+ 12. Qxd2 Nxd2 13. Kxd2 d6 { however, while Black is equal, the

the point here. !? } ) 10... d6 11. Qf3 Nd7 { finally, another piece developed! } 12. h5 { this is premature and lets Black equalize without difficulty. Having

1. d4 f5 { The Dutch Defense is an opening that often uses alternative
move-orders, especially to reach a Stonewall formation, as seen in Annotated
Game #147 (a Slav Stonewall). Here Carlsen plays very straightforwardly with
the text move. This may have had a psychological element as well, since the
Leningrad Dutch - something Carlsen had played recently and lost with - is a
more common choice and essentially requires Black to start with ...f5. } 2. g3 { Anand goes for the standard professional-level approach of a kingside
fianchetto against the Dutch. } 2... Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. c4 c6 { a useful illustration
of move-order importance, as White could exchange on d5 with a slight
advantage if ...d5 were played immediately. } 5. Nf3 d5 6. O-O Bd6 { the
defining position of the main line of the Modern Stonewall. } 7. b3 Qe7 8. Ne5 { Bb2 and a4 (preparing Ba3) are much more popular choices. The text move is the

other two moves - but this may reflect the quality of opposition as well. The
drawback of White's choice here is that it does not immediately help his
development. } 8... O-O { Carlsen drew the one previous game he had played in this
line, with the alternate choice of ...b6 (the modern approach to Stonewall

to play ...b6 and continue his development by getting the light-square bishop
out, the earlier the better. } ( 8... b6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Nc4 Nc6 11. Nxd6+ Qxd6 12. a4 Qd7 13. Ba3 Kf7 14. Nc3 Ba6 15. f3 Rhe8 16. Qd2 Kg8 17. Rfc1 Rac8 18. Ra2 h6 19. Rac2 Na5 20. Rb1 Rc7 21.

now also get off the e-file. } ( 26. Bh2 $16 { still looks very effective. } ) 26... Nxc6 27. Qd6 Qc8 { Black naturally does not exchange on d6, which would create
two monster passed pawns for White. } 28. Nd5 { this position is probably what
White was looking at when she decided to exchange on c6. She still has an edge,
but with fewer pieces on the board there are less attacking chances. } 28... Re8 29. Rxe8+ Qxe8 { with the additional exchange, Black probably was looking to head
into an endgame with a small disadvantage, but with good drawing chances. The
c-pawns look like they can be blockaded effectively. } 30. Nc7 $6 { the idea
behind this move is not clear to me. In the game, it results in Black's queen
moving to a much more effective centralized position, without generating any
evident threats. } ( 30. Bf2 { would be a clever tactical way to improve White's
position and get the Black bishop off the h4-e1 diagonal. The bishop has to
protect f6 due to the fork threat from the Nd5. } ) 30... Qe4 $11 31. Qd5 Bg3 { the bishop is now free to move and attacks the Nc7 "backwards" along the
diagonal. } 32. Nb5 Qe1 { with the threat of ...Bf2 } 33. Nd6 $2 { White chooses
to counterattack with a threat to f7, but she runs out of threats first,
losing the game. } ( 33. Nd4 { is the necessary defensive move. } 33... Nxd4 34. Qxd4 $11 ) 33... Ne5 $1 { holds everything together for Black. } 34. Qa8+ { this starts a
long sequence where Black's king is chased almost the entire length of the
board, but eventually finds refuge. } ( 34. Nxf5 gxf5 35. Qd8+ Kg7 36. Qg5+ Ng6 $19 { is the best try for White, but still leaves Black winning. For example } 37. Qxf5 Be5 38. Qf2 Qc1 39. c6 Qxc4 { and Black's material advantage is
decisive. } ) 34... Kg7 35. Ne8+ Kh6 36. Nf6 Bf2 { Black had to calculate
everything precisely to proceed with this move, but saw correctly that White
would not be able to deliver mate or get a perpetual check. } 37. Qf8+ Kg5 38. Nxh7+ Kf4 39. Qh6+ Ke4 40. Ng5+ Kd3 { White has run out of moves and mate on g1
is coming. } 0-1

1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. a3 { White has many playable options on move
four of the English Four Knights variation. This one is more in the spirit of
a reversed Sicilian, but can also transpose to more standard English positions
(as happens in the game). } 4... g6 { this is a standard English way to develop the
bishop and scores relatively well for Black (around 47 percent). } ( 4... d5 { would be the way to directly challenge White, in the style of the Open
Sicilian (reversed). However Black only scores 42 percent in this line. } ) 5. d3 Bg7 6. Bg5 { this isn't found in many high-level games and is an accelerated
development of the dark-square bishop. } 6... h6 7. Bxf6 { consistent, otherwise
White loses time retreating the bishop. The game is now already out of the
database. } 7... Bxf6 8. g3 O-O 9. Bg2 Bg7 { the bishop retreats to protect h6 and
get out of the way of the f-pawn. } 10. O-O { White now has a rather
standard-looking English position, as does Black. } 10... d6 11. Rb1 { White's typical
plan is to use the b-pawn advance to expand on the queenside and push the Nc6
away, leaving the long diagonal open for White's bishop. } 11... a5 { Black chooses to
(temporarily) challenge the b-pawn advance, rather than move forward with
other development and preparing counterplay on the other wing. The text move
will result in opening the a-file for Black's rook, after the pawn exchange. } 12. b4 axb4 13. axb4 Be6 14. Nd5 $6 { while it's a key principle of the English
to occupy d5 with a knight when advantageous, it's often difficult to
understand when it is best to do so. Here the knight move is premature, as it
would allow Black to block the long diagonal more effectively. } ( 14. b5 Ne7 15. Qc2 { is a standard and good approach. } ) 14... Qd7 { with the evident idea of
playing ... Bh3 as a follow-up. This is rather slow, however. } ( 14... Ne7 $5 { and now } 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7 16. Nd2 c6 17. b5 d5 $15 { is good for Black. For
example } 18. bxc6 bxc6 { and it's clear White has no threats, while Black has a
strong center and better prospects on the queenside as well. } ) 15. Nd2 { this now allows the bishop to support the Nd5, which is in a strong position. } ( 15. b5 Ne7 16. Nd2 { would also be fine. If the Nd5 is exchanged, White would
have doubled d-pawns, but the strength of the d5 pawn would be compensation
for that. } 16... Bxd5 17. cxd5 $11 ) 15... Ra2 { not a bad move, but the resulting
continuation is a little awkward for Black. } ( 15... Ra3 { is the rook move
preferred by Komodo 8. The difference with the text move is that the rook on
a3 controls c3 and cannot be challenged by a White knight. } ) ( 15... Nd4 { is another possibility. The knight otherwise is going to be placed rather
awkwardly after White's b-pawn advance. One sample continution: } 16. e3 Bxd5 17. cxd5 Nb5 $11 ) 16. b5 Nd8 { essentially forced, in order to protect the b7
pawn. } 17. Nb3 { the idea behind this move is apparently to support an eventual
c5 advance. This eventually comes to fruition, but the knight is nevertheless
not optimally placed. } ( 17. Nc3 { is the obvious move here, hitting the Ra2 and
clearing the long diagonal for the bishop. } ) 17... c6 18. Nb4 ( 18. Nc3 { is also still possible. } ) 18... Ra8 19. bxc6 bxc6 20. Qd2 { it's sometimes
difficult in the English to figure out the best square for developing the
queen. In any case, it's important to get the rooks connected and maximize the
queen's utility. Here the choice is between d2 and c2. On d2, the queen has
open diagonals (c1-h6 and a5-e1) but it's not clear if they can ever be
utilized. On c2, it might better support the queenside and would leave d2 open
for the Nb3. } 20... Bh3 $6 { Black follows up with her original idea of exchanging
the Bg2. } ( 20... f5 { is perhaps more to the point, getting Black's counterplay
on the kingside going sooner. } ) 21. Rfd1 $6 { this effectively loses a tempo
for White. } ( 21. Bxh3 $5 { an English player needs to know when to exchange the
Bg2 like this. While Black's queen always looks threatening on h3, without the
support of a knight or advanced pawns it will be less effective. } 21... Qxh3 22. c5 { taking advantage of the Nb3's presence } 22... d5 23. Ra1 $11 ) ( 21. Ra1 { is another
alternative, challenging the Ra8. } ) 21... Bxg2 $15 22. Kxg2 f5 ( 22... Ne6 $5 { would get the knight back in the game, connect the rooks and again control c5. } ) 23. c5 { evidently this was the idea behind the positioning of the Nb3. } 23... d5 24. d4 e4 { Black by this point has a stronger center and more space, so White
needs to turn her attention to trying to contain Black's threats. } 25. f4 { this can be a key defensive move for White in these position types. } 25... exf3+ 26. exf3 f4 27. g4 ( 27. gxf4 $2 Ne6 28. Nd3 Qf7 $17 { and White's shattered
kingside pawns will not provide an adequate defense. } ) 27... Ne6 28. Re1 Ra3 $6 { making this rook more active isn't a bad idea, but again this is not the best
square for it on the a-file. } ( 28... Ra4 { exerts indirect pressure on d4 and
can't be chased off by a knight. } ) ( 28... Rfb8 $5 { gets the other rook into
the game effectively and illustrates how White's opening of the queenside can
also be a weakness, with Black's rooks looking much better placed. } ) 29. Nc2 Raa8 $6 { this makes the maneuver just a waste of time. } ( 29... Ra4 ) 30. Qd3 ( 30. Na5 $5 { threatening Rb7 is an interesting idea. } ) 30... Qf7 31. Re2 $11 { at this point White has blunted Black's initiative and can start manuevering
again. } 31... h5 { a good practical move by Black, as White does not find the best
continuation. } 32. h3 $6 { this sort of defensive move is often instinctual, as
it appears more solid than exchanging on h5. However, in that event White will
be the one controlling the g-file, so it's actually better. } ( 32. gxh5 gxh5 33. Rg1 $11 { followed by Kh1 and White is fine. } ) 32... hxg4 ( 32... Qf6 $15 { threatening to penetrate on the kingside, looks more effective. } ) 33. hxg4 Rae8 { this removes Black's possibility of making threats on the a-file. If Black
wants a rook on e8, Rf8-e8 makes more sense, since the f-pawn is already
overprotected. } 34. Rbe1 { White again looks fine, now that Black's threats
have dissipated. } 34... Bf6 $6 { this is too slow and allows White some initiative. } ( 34... Qf6 $5 ) 35. Nb4 { now the knight is not tied to the d-pawn and can make
threats of its own. } 35... Nd8 { the only way to protect the c-pawn without losing
something somewhere else. } 36. Rxe8 $6 { this is not forced and is a good
example of how it is often better to maintain tension and even increase it,
rather than release it prematurely. } ( 36. Na5 { would be the most challenging
for Black, who would then have to find } 36... Bh4 { to keep things equal. } ) 36... Rxe8 37. Rxe8+ Qxe8 38. Qd2 { at this point the position looks equal/drawn, so
perhaps White simply wanted to head for a draw earlier. } 38... Ne6 39. Na5 Nxd4 { one of multiple drawing continuations. White will win the d5 pawn with her
queen, but this leaves the back ranks open for Black's queen to penetrate and
give perpetual check. } 40. Naxc6 Nxc6 41. Qxd5+ Kg7 42. Nxc6 Qe2+ 43. Kg1 Qe1+ 44. Kg2 Qe2+ 45. Kg1 Qe1+ 1/2-1/2

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 { entering the "Main Line" Caro-Kann, although these
days it's the Advance Variation (3. e5) that is most played at the
professional level. } 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 { the Classical Caro-Kann. } 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 { the standard
position in this line. Now Black varies, however. } 11... a5 $5 { this appears to be a
new idea. Very little played, but with some recent high-level games where
Black scores well. } ( 11... Ngf6 { is normally played here. } ) 12. O-O-O { this
seems to be an almost reflexive choice by White and scores 40 percent in the
database (the alternative c4 scores 0 percent). The logic is that Black no
longer can castle queenside safely, so by default must have the king stay in
the center or castle kingside. White therefore castles queenside and keeps the
rook on the h-file, for future attacking possibilities. This does in part play
into Black's main idea, however, which is to gain space on the queenside and
play there. } 12... Bb4 { this provokes White's next move, which however is not forced.
The move is universally played in the database, an indication that it is
considered the obvious follow-up idea and the reason for playing ...a5 in the
first place. } 13. c3 ( 13. Ne4 $5 { ignoring the bishop sortie and spending the
tempo on mobilizing the knight is another option. } ) 13... Be7 { having done its
job, the bishop returns to its standard square. Now White's king is less
secure, since the c3 pawn is a possible target for a future pawn lever. } 14. Qe2 Ngf6 { at this point we have a standard position, but with c3 and a5 thrown
in. Structurally this has to favor Black a little, but this may be offset by
the tempo invested in the pawn move, unless it is put to further good use. } 15. Ne5 { a standard attacking formation by White, seizing the central square and
freeing up the space in front of the f-pawn. } 15... O-O { while it will take good
defensive (or counter-offensive) skills to protect the Black king, it's still
far better off castled than sitting on the e-file. } 16. f4 Re8 { this is a
standard defensive rook move in this line. While at first glance it may seem
unnecessary, the e6 pawn can become a serious weak point and tactical focus
for White, so the Re8 will help with that, as well as leaving the f8 square
potentially open for a bishop retreat. } 17. Kb1 { this proactively gets the
king off the c-file and protects the a2 pawn. } ( 17. f5 { is played in the only
other game in the database, but Black is able to neutralize this more
aggressive approach. } 17... Bd6 18. fxe6 Rxe6 19. Nf5 Bxe5 20. dxe5 Rxe5 21. Qf3 Qf8 22. g4 Qc5 23. Be3 Qc4 24. Bd4 Qe2 25. Qxe2 Rxe2 26. g5 Ng4 27. Rdg1 c5 28. Rxg4 cxd4 29.

-Socko,B (2611) Germany 2015 } ) 17... a4 { Black normally would be looking to
play the ...c5 break around this time, and this would still be a viable way to
play. However, with the advanced a-pawn and White's king on the queenside, the
text move is natural. } 18. Nf1 { this seems like it just wastes time. Although
it frees up the space in front of the g-pawn, so would the alternative Ne4.
Perhaps White was reluctant to let Black exchange a pair of minor pieces on e4,
fearing it would harm her attacking possibilities. } ( 18. Ne4 Nxe4 19. Qxe4 Nxe5 20. fxe5 a3 21. b3 Bg5 $11 { does look OK for Black, for example. } ) 18... a3 19. b3 c5 $15 { in contrast with the variation above, White's pieces are
uncoordinated and Black's look well placed to follow up on the ...c5 break. } 20. g4 cxd4 21. g5 { the point of White's very aggressive play. Black now
chooses the wrong path. } 21... dxc3 $6 ( 21... hxg5 { this is a difficult move to play
at the board, since it seems that White can now crash through on the kingside
in a typical attack. However, this is not the case. } 22. h6 { for example is a
typical move that normally threatens to break everything open. } ( 22. Nxd7 Nxd7 23. h6 g6 24. fxg5 Bxg5 $15 { is the best the engine can come up with, but
Black is fine. } ) 22... Nxe5 23. h7+ { looks most threatening } ( 23. fxe5 Qd5 $17 ) 23... Kh8 24. fxe5 d3 $19 { and White has nowhere to go on the h-file, thanks
to his own h7 pawn. } ) 22. gxf6 c2+ ( 22... cxd2 { is similar: } 23. fxe7 Qxe7 24. Nxd2 $16 ) 23. Kxc2 Nxf6 $16 { Black has sacrificed a piece for two pawns and an
attack - which is always tempting, but only profitable if the attack lasts.
Here, White's king appears open, but after a few moves she is able to
consolidate her position. } 24. Kb1 { playing it safe, which allows Black the
chance for compensation. } ( 24. Ng3 Rc8+ ( 24... Qc7+ 25. Kb1 Rac8 26. Rc1 $16 ) 25. Kb1 Nd5 26. Qb5 $16 ) 24... Rc8 $6 { this looks like an obvious follow-up,
but is not threatening enough. } ( 24... Qd4 { threatening mate on b2 appears to
be Black's best chance for compensation. It's well worth remembering that
Black often needs to have a centrally-placed queen in order to do well (or
even sometimes survive) in the Classical Caro-Kann. } 25. Bc1 Ne4 $1 { a hard
move to spot, since it leaves the queen hanging. Black will regain the
material after forking on c3. } 26. Rxd4 Nc3+ 27. Ka1 Nxe2 28. Rc4 b5 29. Rc6 Rac8 { looks close to equal. } ) 25. Ng3 { White has the time to redevelop the
knight, heading for e4. } 25... Nd5 26. Rhe1 { this is too slow. } ( 26. Ne4 ) 26... Qb6 27. Ne4 f5 28. Nf2 { now Black can equalize, but she instead goes for a tactic
on e3 that does not fully work. } 28... Rc3 $6 { here the rook cannot be captured, but
the maneuver Nf2-d3 gives White the advantage, unlike in the ...Bh4 variation
where Black would get the exchange in compensation. } ( 28... Bh4 29. Nfd3 Bxe1 30. Rxe1 Rc3 $11 ) ( 28... Qd4 { remains a good idea as well. } ) 29. Nfd3 Rec8 30. Rc1 Rxc1+ 31. Rxc1 Rxc1+ 32. Kxc1 { the exchanges can only benefit White, due
to the material balance. } 32... Qg1+ 33. Kc2 ( 33. Qe1 $5 ) 33... Qa1 34. Nc1 $14 { although White's king is more exposed, this is not sufficient compensation for
the material, since Black cannot put together sufficient threats against it. } 34... Bf6 $2 { overlooking White's threat on the e-file, although White immediately
returns the favor. } ( 34... Qb2+ 35. Kd1 Qd4 $16 { would keep the queen active
and centralized, while making the most of White's king in the center. } ) 35. Ned3 $6 ( 35. Ng6 Qb2+ 36. Kd1 $18 { and either the e6 or b7 pawn will fall to
White's queen. } ) 35... Nc7 ( 35... Kf7 { would protect e6 less awkwardly and
keep the centralized Nd5. } ) 36. Bb4 Bb2 37. Bd6 Bxc1 38. Nxc1 Qb2+ 39. Kd1 $16 { White has covered all her bases and the reduced material makes her advantage
more clear. } 39... Qd4+ { exchanging on e2 would of course just give Black an
obviously lost endgame. } 40. Qd2 Qg1+ 41. Kc2 Nd5 42. Bxa3 { an obvious move,
but threatening the e6 pawn again with the queen (Qe2) might be more
advantageous, as the a3 pawn isn't going anywhere. } 42... Qh1 43. Nd3 Qxh5 { Black is
still fighting hard and looking for imbalances - in this case kingside pawns
to match White's queenside pawn threat - that can give her drawing chances. } 44. Bb2 Qf3 45. a4 h5 46. Bd4 h4 47. Qf2 Qh5 48. Qg1 Qf7 $6 { Black gives up
the queen's activity, which has served her so well up to this point. } ( 48... Qe2+ ) ( 48... Qh6 { would alternatively maintain support for the h-pawn while
pressuring f4. } ) 49. Kb2 Nf6 50. Qg5 { White in contrast now muscles in with
her queen. } 50... h3 { it's looking desperate for Black now. } 51. Nf2 $19 ( 51. Qg3 { is simpler and better, guaranteeing the loss of the h-pawn. } ) 51... h2 52. Qh4 { this allows Black to start making threats again. } ( 52. Qg2 { interestingly is
the only move that retains White's significant advantage, again due to forcing
the issue with the h-pawn. Black unlike in the game cannot play ...Qf7 in
response, as then the response would simply be Bxf6, with the g-pawn pinned. } ) 52... Qd7 53. Bxf6 $6 { White (perhaps in time trouble) seems to want to
simplify, even at the cost of material. } ( 53. Bc3 $5 ) 53... Qd2+ $1 { this
intermediate move equalizes, as opposes to simply recapturing on f6
immediately. } 54. Ka3 Qd6+ $2 { unfortunately, the recapture was now necessary

1. Nf3 g6 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. c4 Nc6 5. Nc3 { via a somewhat unusual
move-order we have arrived at a Symmetrical English. Black will follow the
plan of using ...e5 to challenge for control of the center and break symmetry,
while White pursues a queenside strategy. } 5... d6 6. O-O e5 { this advance gives
Black a lock on d4 and greater central presence/control via her pawns. On the
other hand, it blocks the Bg7 and creates a hole on d5. } 7. d3 { this opens up
the c1-g5 diagonal for the bishop and also helps restrain a potential future ..
.e4 advance. } 7... Nge7 { the standard place for the knight in this variation. The
knight, if placed instead on f6, would get in the way of both the Bg7 and the
f-pawn, which Black may play to f5 at some point. } 8. a3 O-O 9. Rb1 a5 10. Bd2 { White's dark-square bishop development in this line is somewhat problematic,
in that there is no obviously good square for it that does not also get in the
way of other pieces. Keeping it on c1 makes no sense, however, so placing it
on d2 is fine and the most common option. There it may also help control b4
when the time comes to make a pawn break there. } 10... Rb8 11. Ne1 { initiating the
standard plan of repositioning the knight to c2, from where it is able to help
White force through the b4 break. This looks awkward at first glance, but in
reality the knight is doing little on f3 and moving it also opens up the Bg2
to good effect on the long diagonal. } 11... Be6 { Black similarly has little scope
initially for her non-fianchettoed bishop, but there is a more obvious choice
of where to place it. From e6, it can help cover the hole on d5 in tandem with
the Ne7. Black's subsequent push of the d-pawn is also consistent with the
central strategy originally initiated by playing ...e5. } 12. Nc2 d5 13. cxd5 Nxd5 { this recapture is always done with the knight, otherwise White would
gain the advantage of the two bishops after exchanging with the Nc3. } 14. Ne4 { an uncommon move. Exchanging on d5 with the knight is more common, as is the
alternative Ne3. } 14... b6 { the obvious way to protect the c5 pawn. } 15. Ng5 Bc8 { naturally Black wants to preserve the bishop and avoid giving White the two
bishops. } 16. Ne3 { a move that necessarily reflects an understanding of what
is happening on the squares g5 and b4. The game is still in the database,
which interestingly shows White scoring over 70 percent in the dozen games
available, although the position seems quite equal (including to the engine). } 16... Nxe3 ( 16... Qxg5 17. Nxd5 Qd8 18. b4 $11 ) 17. Bxe3 Nd4 { here Black diverges
from previous games, which continued ...Bb7. The most recent example: } ( 17... Bb7 18. Nf3 Kh8 19. Qd2 Re8 20. Rfe1 Qe7 21. Qc2 h6 22. Qc4 f5 23. Qh4 Qxh4 24. Nxh4 Kh7 25. Rec1 Rbc8 26. Kf1 Ba8 27.

tactically defended, as Qxa4 would be followed by ...Nxe2. } 20. b5 Bg4 21. Nf3 ) 20. f3 { this is a committal and seemingly antipositional move by White, who
temporarily shuts off the Bg2 and cuts off the f3 square from the Ng5. However,
it's more dynamic than an alternative like Re1. } ( 20. Nf3 $5 ) 20... Bd7 21. Ne4 axb4 $6 { although Black still has a passed pawn after this trade, having an
outside passed pawn on the a-file would be a greater advantage. } ( 21... a4 { is now an even stronger idea than before, since the passed pawn is protected
by the Bd7. } ) 22. Bxd4 exd4 23. Qb3 { White correctly is not in a rush to
recapture the pawn, choosing to develop her queen first in an effective manner. } 23... Re8 { lining up against the undefended e2 pawn and pinning the knight. This
also frees up the f8 square for a bishop retreat. } 24. f4 { interestingly this
appears to be White's only good move. It frees up the Bg2, most obviously, and
her other pieces are already optimally placed. } ( 24. Qxb4 $2 { this would lift
the pin on the f-pawn, to White's detriment. } 24... f5 25. Nd2 Rxe2 $17 ) 24... Bf8 ( 24... h6 { would be a prophylactic move, taking away the g5 square from the
knight. } ) 25. Ng5 { another example of a patient master-level move. While Black
has protected the b4 pawn, her pawn structure in the center and queenside is
shattered and too vulnerable to protect in the long term. This means that
White need not worry about the material deficit. Instead, she now starts a
threat of her own against the weak f7 square. This threat trumps the previous
pin of the knight against the e2 pawn, which we therefore can say has been
tactically broken. } 25... Be6 { an inaccuracy which allows White to gain some
traction. } ( 25... Qf6 { or ...Qe7 defends the f7 pawn without allowing the
minor piece exchange as in the game. } 26. Bd5 Rxe2 27. Nxf7 Kg7 $11 ) ( 25... Re7 { is also possible. } 26. Bd5 Be8 27. f5 Rxe2 28. Nxf7 Bxf7 29. Bxf7+ Kh8 $11 ) 26. Nxe6 fxe6 { in contrast with the above variations, Black no longer has the
threat of ...Rxe2 because of the pawn on e6. } 27. f5 ( 27. Bc6 $5 Re7 28. Qxb4 { might be a simpler approach, regaining the pawn with the idea of pursuing play
on the queenside. In the game, White instead prefers to increase pressure on
the kingside. } ) 27... gxf5 28. Rxf5 { taking advantage of the pin on the a2-g8
diagonal. } 28... Rc8 { the best way to improve Black's position. She can't do
anything about all of the air in front of her king, but she can activate the
rook on the open file. } 29. Bd5 { an excellent, master-level move. White
increases the pressure on the diagonal in the most effective way, while the
bishop cannot be taken for tactical reasons. } 29... Qd6 { Black appears to be trying
to hold onto the extra material, in this case the b4 pawn, rather than placing
her pieces on the most effective squares. } ( 29... exd5 $2 30. Rxd5 { and Black
will lose material, due to the discovered double check threat. } ) ( 29... Qd7 $5 ) 30. Rg5+ Kh8 31. Be4 { the bishop now needs to be moved, with the tactical
threat of discovered check no longer there. } 31... Rc5 32. Rg4 { exchanging on c5
would just help Black get her pawn structure in order. } 32... b5 { I'm not sure of
the point of this, which may simply be a waiting move. If so, bringing the
rook back to c7 would create fewer potential problems, as we'll see shortly. } 33. Rf1 { bringing another major piece into the kingside attack. } 33... Rc3 34. Rf7 { threatening mate on h7. } 34... Rc7 { now we see why this would have been better
played earlier, as Black is simply a tempo down. } 35. Rf5 { again using
tactical themes involving the e6 pawn. The pawn remains pinned, but this time
against the mating square g8 rather than the Black king. } 35... Bh6 $6 { under
pressure, Black finally cracks. She was probably focused on getting rid of the
mate threat on g8, which is now covered by the Re8. She also probably saw the
threats she could make after placing the bishop on e3, but White is able to
easily parry them. } ( 35... Rc5 ) 36. Rxb5 $16 { now we see another drawback of
Black's move 32. She now has no material compensation for her positional
difficulties. } 36... Be3+ 37. Kg2 Qf8 38. Bf3 { shutting down any threats on the
f-file. } 38... Rc1 39. Qxb4 { ignoring the check on g1. This is also a characteristic
of master-level play, as amateurs too often are afraid of checks. } 39... Rg1+ 40. Kh3 { emotionally these kind of moves can feel awkward and scary, as the king has
very limited squares. However, calculation shows that Black has run out of
threats. } 40... Qf7 $2 { it's not obvious at first glance why this is bad, although
White is able to quickly achieve a won position. Black does not realize that
she has effectively given up control over the 8th rank. } ( 40... Qxb4 { is
judged best by the engine, although it will likely result in a winning endgame
for White. } ) 41. Qd6 $18 { and there is nothing Black can do to avoid mate or
major material losses. The immediate threat is Qe5+, while the queen can also
support exchanging off the Re8. } ( 41. Rb8 { is probably the easiest winning
continuation to spot, although the text move is more elegant and decisive. The
problem for Black is that her back rank is under-defended, given the control
of the Rg4 over the g-file and Black's king in the corner. } 41... Qh5+ 42. Rh4 Qf5+ 43. g4 Qf7 44. Qb7 Qxb7 45. Rxe8+ Kg7 46. Bxb7 $18 ) 41... Qf6 ( 41... Bh6 42. Qxd4+ Bg7 43. Qxg1 $18 ) 42. Rb8 Qh6+ 43. Rh4 Qg6 44. Rxe8+ Qxe8 { unfortunately
for Black, getting rid of the 8th rank threat has now left her vulnerable
again on the a1-h8 diagonal. } 45. Qe5+ Kg8 46. Rg4+ 1-0

either overlook or discount the possibility of the pawn fork trick Ndxe4,

White. } ( 12... f5 $5 { would address the issue. } ) 13. Be2 ( 13. Ndxe4 dxe4 14. d5 Bxd5 { and now } 15. Nxd5 { is much more awkward for Black than in the above

additional time by the a3 pawn. } ) 13... O-O 14. b4 { in these types of

play on the kingside. The bishop of course cannot be exchanged without giving
White an attack. } 19... g6 $15 { however, with this simple move, which has no real
drawbacks for Black, White effectively loses a tempo and Black gains the
initiative. The engine has shown a small plus for Black for several moves; at
this point it becomes more evident. } 20. Be2 Qd6 { the queen occupies the best
logical square for the knight currently stuck on the rim (Na7-c8-d6). However,
we will see there are compensations for this. } 21. O-O h5 22. Qe1 Rae8 { this gets the rook into the game, so at least there aren't two unproductive
pieces on the a-file. However, it could be of more use on the c-file, and
eventually goes there. } 23. Nb1 { Black's space advantage is now obviously
seriously cramping White. } 23... Bd8 24. Rc2 Kg7 { getting the king out of the way of
the rook, so it can go to the h-file. This could also have been played a move
earlier. } 25. Qc1 Rh8 { White now faces a serious problem on the h-file and the
kingside in general, with Black threatening to advance ...h4 and crack open
his position. } 26. f4 $6 { White probably did not want to be squeezed to death

position is better exploited by Black. } 26... exf3 27. Rxf3 Qb4 $17 28. N3d2 Bg5 { the bishop finally gets active. } 29. Nf1 { White's structure at this point is
simply awful, with doubled g-pawns and a backward e-pawn that desperately
needs protection. All White has going for her at this point is the c-file,
which however can be easily challenged by Black. } 29... Rc8 ( 29... Qxa4 { is also
possible, but pawn snatching is not necessary for Black to further improve her
position. } ) 30. Rxc8 ( 30. Nc3 $5 { would put up stronger resistance. } ) 30... Rxc8 31. Qd1 { now Black controls the c-file as well, with additional threats

pressure in the middlegame. } ) 39. Kh2 a4 { passed pawns must be pushed! } 40. Rf2 a3 41. Nf3 Bf6 42. Nh4 Bxh4 { well worth exchanging at this point, as the
bishop was not doing much otherwise and it eliminates a possible attacker. } 43. gxh4 Bd7 { going for the obvious b5 target. } 44. Qf3 Qd6+ 45. Ng3 Nxb5 { at this
point it's hard to see how Black could possibly lose, although White perhaps
was pinning some hope on a sacrificial kingside breakthrough. } 46. Qe2 Nc7 ( 46... Qe7 { would be an elegant tactical way of meeting the threat, with the
idea being ...Qxh4 followed by Qxg3. } ) 47. Qd2 Rc6 { Black over the next few
moves sorts out her pieces and then finally gets her queenside pawns moving,
which decides the game. } 48. Rf4 Ne6 ( 48... b5 { immediately is more effective,
as White cannot stop the next move to b4 and Black puts more pressure on her
opponent immediately. It is instructive to note, however, that Black having
built up such a positional advantage can take the time to sort her pieces -

standard continuation of c4. } 6... d6 7. Qb3+ { the most popular idea as a follow-up.
White takes advantage of the diagonal being clear. } 7... e6 { this is something of a
concession to White, as Black would prefer to be able to play e5, but on the
positive side the move also reinforces d5, while e6 is no longer a weak point. } 8. Bg5 { Ng5 is popular here, opening up the long diagonal for the bishop, as
well as the more prosaic Nbd2. } 8... Qe8 $146 { the usual idea behind this move in
the Leningrad is to support an advance of the e-pawn, as well as give the
queen a path to the kingside after g6 is vacated. } ( 8... Nc6 $5 { scores the
best for Black, albeit based on only a handful of games. The point is that the
pawn advance d5 is not possible at this stage, unlike in the main line with a
pawn on c4. } ) 9. Nbd2 Nh5 { Black decides to leave the queenside undeveloped
and start operations on the kingside immediately. } 10. Ne1 h6 11.

the time now to secure the b-pawn, when he could continue pressing in the
center. } ( 15... e5 $5 { would force the issue. } 16. dxe5 dxe5 $11 ) 16. g4 { White can do a variety of things here. This does not seem to be the most
productive, however. } 16... Nf6 { Black chooses to decline the sacrifice. Nakamura
tends to be the one who prefers having initiative or other compensation for
material, rather than the other way around. } ( 16... fxg4 17. Rxf8+ Bxf8 { is evaluated as equal by the engine. White has some play for the pawn on the
kingside and down the f-file. } ) 17. gxf5 exf5 { while Black's pawn structure is
shattered on the kingside, White is no better. Black's pawn on f5 is also
difficult to attack and he has prospects on the g-file. } 18. Bf2 Be6 19. Qc2 Bd5 20. Nf3 Be4 { after this lengthy bishop maneuver, Black has fully equalized
and seems to have a clearer strategy to follow on the kingside. } 21. Qd2 Ne7 { with the Be4 covering the diagonal, the knight can now reposition itself
without risk. } 22. Bh4 { White looks to exchange his "bad" bishop for one of
Black's good knights, but this also will remove a key dark-square defender
from the game. } 22... Ng6 23. Bxf6 Rxf6 24. Rf2 c5 { this move highlights one of the
interesting things about the Dutch, in that Black has to look at playing on
all portions of the board to be most effective, and not just fixate on the
kingside. Black now threatens to push ...c4 and would welcome the open d-file
if the pawn were exchanged. } 25. Raf1 Qe6 26. a3 Rg8 $17 { Black can now build
up pressure rather easily on the kingside and center (g- and e-files) and he
has firmly taken over the initiative. } 27. Kh1 Kh7 28. Qe3 { this move
highlights how White's pieces are awkwardly placed and not cooperating well,
as well as the lack of constructive plans available to White. } 28... Re8 29. Qd2 Rg8 30. Qe3 { a repetition sequence that no doubt helped with the time control. } 30... c4 31. Nf4 $6 { this allows Black to solve the problem of what to do with the Ng6,
as he now exchanges it off and places a much more effective rook on the square. } ( 31. Nde1 $5 ) 31... Nxf4 32. Qxf4 Rg6 33. h3 { this does not appear very
helpful, but White is in serious difficulty anyway. } ( 33. Rg1 $5 ) 33... Bf6 34. Kh2 Be7 35. Bh1 { evidently the point of the earlier maneuvers on the h-file.
Removing the bishop as a target does not rescue White from his predicament,
however. } 35... R8g7 { clearing the g8 square for the queen. } 36. Rg2 Bg5 $1 { the key
move and the result of excellent calculation by Black. } 37. Qg3 ( 37. Nxg5+ hxg5 $19 { and both the Qf4 and Rg2 are attacked, so White loses material. } ) 37... Bc1 $19 { White is now embarrassed on the g-file. } 38. Rxc1 { White cannot save
the queen without giving a winning attack to Black. For example } ( 38. Qf2 Bf4+ 39. Kg1 Bg3 40. Qe3 f4 41. Qc1 ( 41. Qd2 Qxh3 42. e3 Bh2+ ) 41... Qxh3 $19 ) ( 38. Qh4 Rxg2+ 39. Bxg2 Qg6 40. Bh1 Be3 $19 { and White has no good moves, with
mating possibilities for Black looming. } ) 38... Rxg3 39. Rxg3 Bxf3 { Black

play after starting with 1...f5. } 5. Bd3 { normally in the man line White

nevertheless considered "hot" because of recent high-level games, including
this one. Black intends to follow the old Stonewall development plan with the

Black. } 12... c5 { the Stonewall pawn formation is not intended to be a static

queenside, so perhaps that was her original strategic concept. } 18. Rb1 Ra8 19. Na4 a5 20. bxa5 { this release of tension seems to favor Black's idea, rather

his kingside plan of gaining space with his pawns and eventually assaulting
White's king position. White however can prevent Black from fully seizing the
initiative with some immediate threats on the queenside and in the center. } 10. b5 $14 { Komodo 8 shows a slight plus here (around half a pawn). White enjoys a
small lead in development and should be able to usefully exploit the space
advantage on the queenside, as well as control of d5. } 10... Ne7 11. Qc2 $146 { White has a lot of choices here, with none of them being obviously better.
Developing the queen to b3 appears more effective, though, as it fights for d5
and the a2-g8 diagonal offers greater possibilities. The text move eyes the e2
pawn and the e4 square for defensive purposes, but after a future Nd2 this
queen placement is not as useful. } 11... f4 { an obvious follow-up, also opening up
the diagonal for the light-square bishop. } 12. Ba3 { the only effective square
to develop the bishop, given Black's pawn structure. } 12... O-O 13. c5 { note how
with the queen on b3 this would have more bite to it, as it would come with
discovered check. } ( 13. Nd2 { as a preparatory move looks effective here, as
the Nf3 is doing little where it is and the long diagonal is now opened up for
the bishop. } ) 13... fxg3 ( 13... Be6 $11 ) 14. fxg3 $11 { an uninspired, if safe
choice. } ( 14. Qb3+ $5 { leads to a more imbalanced position, for example } 14... Kh8 15. hxg3 Nf5 16. cxd6 cxd6 17. e4 { this blocks the Bg2, but drives away
Black's well-placed knight and establishes more central control in return,

tension may simplify the situation, but it is in White's best interests to
make Black have to focus on potential unresolved issues in the center, rather
than on his kingside play. The disappearance of the c-pawn also allows Black
to exploit the a7-g1 diagonal, which I missed during the game. } 15... cxd6 16. Qb3+ Kh8 17. Qb4 Qb6+ $15 18. Kh1 Nf2+ 19. Rxf2 { this is forced, but Black despite

compensates for the material. Black also does not have a real attack on the
kingside, although he tries his best. } 21... Ne3 22. Rg1 Bf5 23. Bxf8 { I claw back
the material, although Black still has a positional advantage, with more

does not offer any advantage to Black. } ( 10... Rc8 $5 ) 11. fxg3 { a weakening
move that indicates my opponent is looking to play aggressively by opening the
f-file for his rook. } 11... a6 { Controls b5, but this is essentially a wasted move,
as White is not threatening anything on the kingside. I could (and should)
have castled immediately, but wanted to see more of my opponent's intentions
first. } 12. Qd2 O-O { I correctly assess that Black is solid and should not
worry too much about White's threatening gestures. } 13. Rae1 Rac8 14. Ne5 { an impatient move. White was evidently hoping for an exchange, which would be
to his favor with a pawn established on e5 and no good retreat square for the
Nf6. However, I do not oblige and simply retreat the queen to a better square. } 14... Qd8 15. h3 { White returns my earlier favor of a wasted move (...a6) with one
of his own. } ( 15. Nxc6 bxc6 16. Na4 Ne4 $15 ) 15... b5 ( 15... Nxe5 { now is good

position, up a pawn equivalent. White's pieces are scattered and uncoordinated,
while Black will have strong pressure on the queenside and against the e5 pawn. } ) 16. a3 { Consolidates b4, notes Houdini via the Fritz interface. } 16... Qc7 { a passive move and it also overlooks a tactical shot on f6, now only protected
by the g-pawn, which would give White a forced draw. } ( 16... Nxe5 17. Rxe5 Rc4 $17 ) 17. g4 ( 17. Rxf6 gxf6 18. Qh6 fxe5 19. Qg5+ Kh8 20. Qf6+ $11 ) 17... Nxe5 $15 { now I play the right move. } 18. Rxe5 Nd7 19. Rh5 { White continues to play

easily, but could have obtained an advantage instead. } 20... Nf6 { this puts the

White had a dark-square bishop, Black could be in trouble. In this case,
however, White's attack has nowhere left to go. } 24. Rh6 { White's optimistic
desire to attack now goes too far. The rook visually looks more threatening on
h6, perhaps the reason for my opponent's choice, but it in fact does nothing
for him there and becomes a liability shortly. } ( 24. Rf4 Nd6 $15 ) 24... f5 ( 24... Nd6 { immediately is better. } 25. Qf6 Rfe8 $17 ) 25. g4 $2 Nd6 $19 26. Qe3 Ne4 27. Nxe4 $2 { an oversight. But White was lost anyway, states Houdini via

correctly increases the pressure against the backward a-pawn. } 26... Rd7 27. Ra3 { this is not in fact a bad move, but it marks the beginning of my strategic
confusion. I did not understand that my queen should be redeployed along the
second rank, as it rather useless on b3. This should be accompanied by
increased pressure along the a-file with doubled rooks. In the game I
understood the benefits of doubling rooks, but got distracted by Black's pawn
advances. As a final point, moving Ra6 would have been just as good as the
text move for doubling purposes and would have also blockaded the a-pawn and
exerted some indirect pressure along the sixth rank. } 27... f4 { Black wins space,
notes Houdini. } 28. Rf1 { White is still fine objectively, but this move starts
the strategic slide. } 28... Rf8 { with the obvious threat of ...fxe3, as the Rf1 is

the queenside and have effectively lost the initiative, although the position
remains equal. } ( 29. Qd1 { would reposition the queen to a much more effective

now could open up on the long diagonal with the Bg7. } 32. Rh1 $6 ( 32. Be4 $14 { is a clever way of blocking the advance of the e-pawn, while maintaining
protection of the d3 pawn and controlling f5 and g6. } ) 32... e4 $11 33. Rad1 exd3 { this should let White off the hook. } ( 33... g4 $5 ) 34. Qxd3 $14 Be5 35. Kg1 { this should still be good enough for a draw, but bolder, more active

comparison with the main line, White now takes an extra tempo to exchange off

occupies an excellent diagonal and its White counterpart is hemmed in by
Black's pawn structure. Although this is one of Houdini's top choices,
according to the database it is a novelty. Presumably White players are
normally looking for something more ambitious in this variation. } 13... Bxd3 14. Qxd3 Nbd7 { we now have a standard-looking Caro-Kann structure from the main line,
the difference being that White has bishop for knight. While this may provide
a slight edge, it is worth noting that White's knights can be effective
attackers in the main line, especially when targeting e6/f7, which is not
possible here due to the absence of both the light-square bishop and a
suitably placed knight. } 15. Rfd1 Re8 16. c4 Qa5 { the idea being to restrain
b4 and develop the queen to a more useful square. Also worth noting is how the

opportunity to tactically remove the a-pawn from threat; the b-pawn cannot
capture en passant, which would abandon the Nc6 to its fate. } 31. Kf2 Rd7 32. Ne5 { with the a-pawn now out of reach, the knight returns to its previous
outpost to again threaten a 7th rank target. } 32... Rc7 { the rook is still tied to

course solid for White. This move is frequently seen at the Class level. } 4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bg4 { this is essentially Black's ideal setup out of this variation and
the database statistics show it, as Black scores close to 63 percent. } 6. dxc5 { Kosintseva has played this frequently, including a prior game against
Kosteniuk from earlier this year in May. Black therefore must have had the
expectation that White would enter this line. The capture is usually made on
move 4 when first possible; this variation can be reached alternatively by
White playing the capture and following up with 6. c3, which however is not
the most aggressive continuation. } 6... a6 $146 { a novelty on move 6! However,
perhaps not so unusual when it's one of Houdini's top choices. The move also
appears in their previous game, at a later point. Here it helps restrain the
idea of White pushing the b-pawn. } ( 6... e6 { is what Kosteniuk played before

"little tactic" was of course foreseen by White. In other lines with an
earlier dxc5, White may try to hang on to the extra pawn. Here white cedes the
e5 pawn, but in exchange gets the two bishops. } 8. Qxf3 Nxe5 9. Qd1 { White
evidently wants to keep her options open regarding future placement of the
queen. } 9... e6 10. Be2 Ne7 { in this French-type structure, the knight development
with Ne7-f5 is both common and effective. } 11. b4 { reinforcing c5 and untying
the Be3 from the pawn's defense. } 11... Nf5 12. Bf4 Nc6 { by this point Black has
comfortable equality, with a dynamic balance between the minor pieces and pawn
structures. Black's position looks more natural to play, although there is no
real advantage. } 13. O-O g6 ( 13... Be7 { is also possible, with the idea of
exchanging off the Bf4. } ) 14. Bd3 { the bishop was accomplishing nothing on its
previous diagonal and has limited scope, given Black's pawn structure, so now
it is going to exchange itself off. } 14... Bg7 15. Bxf5 gxf5 { this looks like a
strange line for Black to enter, but a similar structure can occur, for
example, in the Caro-Kann Exchange Variation. Black argues that the
possibility of using the open g-file and stronger central pawn structure
outweigh the weakening of the kingside. } 16. Bd6 a5 ( 16... Bf8 { is Houdini's
preference, seeking to exchange the Bd6 or drive it away. } ) ( 16... Nxb4 17. Re1 Qd7 { is an interesting possibility; the c3 pawn cannot capture, as it is
pinned to the Ra1. Black cannot hold onto the pawn (the d5 pawn can be
captured once the knight moves, due to the pin on the e6 pawn), but it would
be another way to disrupt White's queenside pawns. Play could continue } 18. a4 Rg8 19. g3 a5 20. Ra3 Na6 21. Qxd5 O-O-O $5 ) 17. bxa5 { this seems to be
exactly what Black wanted. } ( 17. b5 { it is unclear to me why White would not
prefer this to the text move, as it mobilizes the queenside pawn majority to
good effect. } ) 17... Rxa5 18. Nd2 { evidently heading for b3 to help protect c5.

rook advanced and mobile along the open fourth rank. } 20. Nd2 Ra3 21. Rb1 Be5 { Black finally decides to exchange off the bishop. } 22. Bxe5 Nxe5 23. Re1 Ng6 ( 23... Nd3 24. Re3 Nxc5 25. Nb3 Nxb3 26. axb3 O-O { is evaluated as equal by the

decides to take one of the pawns offered to her. } 25. Nf3 O-O 26. h4 f6 $6 { this covers g5 and e5, but weakens e6 at the same time. } ( 26... Qc7 { instead

of one of Black's doubled pawns. } 35. Rxa7 Qxa7 36. Qxf5 Qg7 ( 36... Qf7 { would neutralize a possible h5 push. } 37. h5 Nf4 38. Re4 Nxh5 39. Rh4 Nf4 40. Nxe5 fxe5 41. Rxh7+ Qxh7 42.

played (and also the most theoretical). } 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 { Spassky introduced this move into top-level play and made it the standard. It
is an aggressive pawn thrust, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the
bishop's location and White's natural orientation to kingside play in this
variation. } 6... h6 7. Nf3 e6 { a rare move, although Anand himself has played this,
along with the main line ...Nd7 and the alternative ...Nf6. The main line
prevents Ne5 by allowing Black to immediately exchange off the knight, so the
game continuation is the natural reaction. } 8. Ne5 Bh7 { no other square is
safe for the bishop. } 9. Bd3 { exchanging off the bishop is the most popular,
also logical from the standpoint of gaining time, as Black's bishop has made
more moves than White's equivalent and White will be left with more pieces

attempt to snatch a pawn with ...Qxd4 fails to 10. Nxf7! } 9... Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nd7 { this knight needs to be developed sooner or later and challenging Black's Ne5

Ne5, then this continuation makes sense to keep the space advantage on the

castle queenside, as the kingside pawn shield is now almost nonexistent. (See

the bishop out without giving Black a target, was the idea, but a relatively

significantly better. Black will have some good piece activity and easy
development, but no other significant compensation for the pawn. } ) 7... Bf5 8. Nxd5 { an exchange that gives Black an active queen, so not the best decision.

in this case the material advantage is limited to a lone pawn and I had lesser
development, so exchanging off one of my two developed pieces and giving Black
another developed piece resulted in a gain in time for Black. } ( 8. g3 { immediately would be fine, as White has no need to exchange in the center. } ) 8... Qxd5 9. Nc3 Qd7 10. g3 Bb4 ( 10... Bh3 { seems like it would be annoying,

way of effectively getting to it, while the Nd5 looks quite strong. In this
line, Black also has no time to play ...h6 and kick the bishop. } 15... Bg4 16. Qd2 ) 13... Bd6 { this is a good exchange for White, reducing the minor piece count

any any ideas involving Nb5, but White now has some other good moves available.

the knight while giving the Rc1 some useful pressure down the c-file. Nc5
would now be a threat as well, so Black should probably exchange on e4. } ) ( 17. Na4 { is another idea targeting the c5 square and looking to break up and
weaken Black's queenside pawns. For example } 17... a5 18. Bxc6 bxc6 19. Qc2 ) 17... Qh6 { hoping to generate some kingside pressure. } 18. Nd5 { I missed Black's
next move, which takes away the knight's support on d5 and makes the idea of
snatching the c pawn less strong, since the knight would not have a retreat
square afterwards. Despite still having a significant advantage, mentally the
disruption of my original idea helped move the game towards a negative trend
for me. } 18... Bh3 19. Nf4 $6 ( 19. Nxc7 { is in fact still possible, although not

avoid the trade of the fianchettoed bishop, but unfortunately it did not occur

require too much awkwardness to defend, but Houdini finds a concrete, tactical
continuation leading to an advantage. } 19... Bg4 20. Rc4 { interesting to see how

but there were other good reasons for the queen development, to ratchet up the
pressure on White. } ) 11. cxd4 Bb4 { this seemed to me to have better long-term

target d4) as an option. } 12. Nc3 O-O 13. Qd3 $146 { Whtie is now out of the

initial middlegame plan, I had settled on pressuring d4 some more, with ...Bb6

overloaded pawn at e6, which was protecting both f5 and d5. } ( 15. Bg4 { is
Houdini's preferred alternative. } 15... Nxe3 16. fxe3 Qg5 $11 ) 15... Nh4 { Black has

takes the queen's place on d8, that I spot the Nxe5 threat. The move increases
pressure on the backward pawn d4 and re-establishes the pin. } 19. Ne2 { this

resolve his issues via simplification. } 19... Qxe4 20. Nxe4 Bb6 $11 { and now that
Black's queen is no longer on the board, he can't take advantage of White's
kingside weaknesses, although he will have easy equality after regaining the

directly challenged by White without creating other problems in his position. } ) 22. Rg1 { a rather transparent threat to play Bh6 as a follow-up. } 22... g6 { the most
obvious way to defend. } ( 22... Rfe8 { is a better defense, removing the rook
from the line of fire. This would have effectively saved a tempo for Black -
g6 does nothing for him - as well as better anticipating White's coming d5
push. } ) 23. Rgd1 Bb6 24. d5 Bxe3 25. fxe3 Ne5 { I had to think about this one
for a while as well, although there was less of a choice available than with
the previous knight move. Houdini approves. } 26. Rc7 { the critical (and
obvious) try for White. } 26... Rc8 27. Rdc1 { with time getting shorter, my thinking
process started breaking down around here, as I didn't even consider this
possibility for White. } ( 27. Rxb7 { fails due to } 27... Rc2 { which will win the Ne2
because of the pin on the Kh2. } ) 27... Rcd8 { the riskier play, as at the time
I didn't like the alternative. } ( 27... Rxc7 { is fine, however as } 28. Rxc7 exd5 29. exd5 Rd8 30. e4 Rd7 { and Black is equal, being able to stop the pawns with
his piece blockade. } ) 28. Nf4 exd5 29. exd5 { Black is still OK, although that
pawn on d5 sure looks good for White. } 29... Rfe8 { continuing the aggressive and
risky play } ( 29... b5 { is Houdini's inspired choice, creating an outpost for
Black on c4 that allows him to compensate for White's rampaging rook on the
7th rank. } 30. Rxa7 Nc4 ) 30. Rxb7 $14 Nf3+ 31. Kg2 { White threatens to win
material: Kg2xf3 } 31... Rxe3 $2 { this is shown by Houdini to lose for Black,

White. Now the Re8 is overloaded and Black's pieces cannot protect each other
and at the same time stop the advancing d-pawn. } ) 33... Ng5 $11 { now Black's
pieces are no longer overloaded and the position is equal. } 34. h4 Rf3+ { I thought for some time here and concluded that Black should get a perpetual
check out of this sequence. } 35. Kg2 Rxf4 36. hxg5 Rf5 { now the king would not
be close enough to the rook to be able to fend off the checks by
counterattacking. } 37. Re7 $2 { White desperately wants to win, so plays

White to pressure the center. } 10. Qb3 b6 $6 { the main problem positionally
with this move is that it loses control of c6. } ( 10... Nc6 11. f3 ( 11. Qxb7 { would see White pawn-hunting without sufficient support for his queen. For

defenders. Also, retreats (in this case b3-c2) are typically harder to see
mentally. } 14... Re8 $2 { despite the engine's question mark, during the game I
thought that this was the best practical try for Black, setting up some
possible tactics along the e-file. } ( 14... Qc8 $5 $16 { is the defense found by
Houdini, which postpones the fate of the e-pawn due to the pin on the Nc3. The
engine still rates White with a strong positional plus, however. } ) 15. Nxe4 $18 Nbd7 ( 15... Nxe4 16. Qxe4 Bg5 { is a possibility that I looked at for some time
before taking the e-pawn, since if White snatched the Ra8 it looked like it

chose a less tactical line, in any case. } ) 16. Bf3 { I didn't think that Black
would actually miss the Nxf6+ discovered attack on the Ra8, but thought the
bishop would be better on the long diagonal anyway. This comfortably holds
White's advantage. Houdini however points out the attacking value was better
on c4. } ( 16. Ng5 $5 { would set up a potential sacrifice on f7. } 16... Rf8 ( 16... h6 $2 17. Nxf7 Kxf7 18. Bc4+ Kf8 19. Qg6 { with mate coming. } ) 17. Bc4 $18 ) 16... Rc8 $16 17. Nxf6+ Nxf6 18. Qf2 { this was the other reason for moving the

shortly become apparent. } ( 18... Bd6 $5 19. g3 $14 ) 19. Bd2 { this is part of

- but I had to look at the possible rook invasion on c2. } ( 19. e4 $5 $16 { I considered this, which would get the central pawn roller moving, but thought
it would be too risky. } ) 19... Bd6 ( 19... Rc2 20. Rfc1 $5 { was my primary line } ( 20. Qe1 { is better } ) 20... Rxb2 21. Qe1 { with the idea that now Black has to
watch out for his rook being trapped. } ) 20. Rac1 $16 { now White can dominate
the c-file, since Black's rook on c7 - while defended twice - can be exchanged
off at will and Rc1 then played. } 20... Ne4 { I had seen this possibility and decided
that it wasn't worth trying to avoid. The exchange is essentially forced, but
leaves White that much closer to a winning endgame. The trade also removes an
obstacle to White pushing e4. } 21. Bxe4 Rxe4 22. Qf5 { I selected this because
it was the most active option for the queen and posed several problems - the
immediate attack on e4, the potential control of c8 in tandem with a rook
(which is what eventually happens), and an attack on h7. Regarding the last
possibility, White has some threats involving a rook lift (Rf1-f3-h3) and the
Bd2 would be a great help in a kingside attack once e4 is played. } 22... Rh4 $6 { I had looked at this variation and thought it was superficially attractive,
but in the end lead nowhere for Black. } ( 22... Re8 23. Qf3 $16 ) 23. g3 { the obvious response, blocking the attack on h2 and kicking the rook. } 23... Rh6 $2 { now if Black had the time to play Rf6, he could solve his problems. But he

nothing better in the position, says Houdini. } 26. Rxc7 gxf5 27. Rxa7 Bf8 $18 ) 26. Rc8+ Bf8 27. Bb4 { I have to admit that I stopped calculating at this point,
seeing no viable way out for Black. } 27... g5 { I told Rocky in the post-game
discussion that this was a fiendishly clever try. It certainly made me work
for the win. the point is that the rook can now contribute defensively, unlike
after ...g6. } 28. Bxf8 { not the quickest way, but still a mate. } 28... Rc6 { stopping
Bh6 delivering mate. } 29. Qxg5+ { it took me a while to figure out an accurate
continuation. Among other things I considered bailing out into a won queen
endgame by exchanging rooks on c6, which however would have been a real
struggle. The necessary follow-on Qd8 was not obvious to me, at first. } 29... Rg6 { forced. Now White finds the move that protects the rook and keeps the back
rank mate threats alive. Black will have to either give up the queen or accept
mate immediately. } 30. Qd8 { RockyRook resigns } 1-0
