{ This is a study for players rated 1300-1700 :)
Find a good first move for white!

If you want to help me with my newest project (analysing master games and maybe making them interactive too) message me! }
1. g3 { This is the Hungarian Opening, but there is a much more simple way to start the game. } (1. e4 { Very good. e4 is one of the best moves to start with. } { [%clk 0:45:00] } 1... e5 { Black answers with e5. What next? } { [%clk 0:45:00] } 2. Nf3 { Very good! This move is developing a piece :) } { [%clk 0:44:54] } (2. Bc4 { This is a good move too, but usually we start with the knight. }) (2. Nc3 { This move is okay, but a little bit passive. }) (2. Ba6 { Black can take the bishop! } { [%csl Ga6][%cal Gb7a6] }) 2... Nc6 { Black defends with Nc6. What now? } { [%clk 0:44:46] } 3. Bb5 { Very good! This is called Ruy Lopez. And it's a strong opening for white. } { [%clk 0:44:52] } (3. c3 { This move blocks the knight. Try something else! } { [%cal Gb1c3,Gb1d2] }) (3. Bc4 { Strong move! But there is a better one! } { [%csl Gf7][%cal Gc4f7] }) (3. Nc3 { This move is a little bit passive. }) 3... a6 { Where should we move the bishop? } { [%clk 0:44:13] } 4. Ba4 { Correct. The bishop stays in the diagonal. Also he may exchange later. } { [%csl Gc6][%cal Ga4e8] [%clk 0:44:50] } (4. Bc4 { There is a better move. }) 4... b5 { Where should we move the bishop now? } { [%clk 0:44:06] } 5. Bb3 { Very good! Now we are on the same diagonal as with c4, but black's pawn structure is questionable. } { [%csl Bc4][%cal Gb3f7,Bf1c4,Gb5a4,Ga4b3] [%clk 0:44:48] } 5... Bb7 { Black uses the created hole to develop his bishop. What is the next logical move for white? } { [%clk 0:44:03] } 6. O-O { Correct. Castling provides king safety. } { [%clk 0:43:25] } (6. d4 { That is the best move, but another one was played. }) 6... Bc5 { Black attacks with his bishop. What should we play next? } { [%clk 0:43:48] } 7. c3 { Very good! This move reduces options for black, provides space and prepares the move d4! } { [%csl Rb4,Rd4][%cal Gb3c2,Gd2d4] [%clk 0:43:19] } (7. d3 { d3 is a solid move, but too passive and not fighting enough for the center. }) (7.

Bb6 { Black gets the bishop to a safer place. What next? } { [%clk 0:43:44] } 8. d4 { Yes! We play d4 anyway. We fight for the center! } { [%csl Gd5,Gd4,Ge5,Ge4] [%clk 0:42:05] } (8. Nxe5 { This move loses the knight! } { [%csl Ge5][%cal Gc6e5] }) 8... Na5? { Black puts his knight in a bad position to attack our bishop. How should we use this against him? } { [%clk 0:43:29] } 9. Bxf7+ { Knight takes e5 is better, but if black makes a mistake now he will lose a lot. } { [%clk 0:41:12] } (9. Nxe5 { This wins a pawn, but a sacrifice could be more interesting. }) (9. Bc2 { Definitely one of the best moves. In the game another was played. }) 9... Kxf7 { We sacrificed the bishop. How do we get enough compensation? } { [%clk 0:43:18] } 10. Nxe5+ { Correct. We take control of the center and attack the king again. } { [%clk 0:41:10] } (10. Bg5 { Good move, but it gives black the opportunity to develop his knight. } { [%cal Gg8f6] }) 10... Ke8 { Black moves the king to the wrong place. What next? } { [%clk 0:43:00] } 11. Qh5+ { Perfect. Kf8 is mate and g6 loses the rook. (In the game g6 was played, but we will discuss the third option) } { [%cal Gg7g6,Ge5g6,Be8f8] [%clk 0:41:07] } 11... Ke7 { Ke7?? What is your reaction to this move? } 12. Qf7+ { Correct! The king has only one square! } { [%cal Ge7d6] } (12. Na3 { This knight isnt helping a lot there. }) (12. Re1 { There is a much better move. }) (12. f4 { This is bad as it opens up the diagonal for the bishop. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gb6g1] }) (12. f3 { This is bad as it opens up the diagonal for the bishop. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gb6g1] }) (12.

But there is a better move. } { [%cal Gg6h8,Gg6e7] }) 12... Kd6 { How do you continue? } 13. Nc4+!! { Very well! We keep checking the king so we have time to activate more pieces. } (13. c4 { Nice attempt, but there is something better! :) }) (13. f4 { This is bad as it opens up the diagonal for the bishop. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gb6g1] }) (13. f3 { This is bad as it opens up the diagonal for the bishop. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gb6g1] }) (13.

Nxc4 { Now how do we checkmate? } 14. Bf4+ { Right! The king is trapped in his own bishop-pawn structure. } (14. e5+ { This doesn't lead to a checkmate. Black can take with his knight. } { [%csl Ge5][%cal Gc4e5] }) (14. f4 { This move is losing. Queen and bishop are both quite trapped. } { [%csl Ge4,Rc1,Rf7][%cal Gb7e4] }) (14. d5 { This way black can recover. } { [%csl Gf6][%cal Gd8f6] }) (14.

Qg6+ { This move loses the Queen. } { [%csl Gg6][%cal Gh7g6] }) 14... Ne5 { How should we take the knight? } 15. Bxe5+ { Correct! Keeping the pawn structure healthy and keeping control over the c5 square. } { [%csl Gc5] } (15. dxe5+ { This is correct too, but usually it is better to keep a healthy pawn structure as you don't always see if there will be a mate. } { [%cal Gd6c5,Gb2b4] }) 15... Kc6 { Black blocks of his own bishop. How do we checkmate? } 16. Qd5# { Perfect! You won the game.

Here e4 was played. }) (1. b3 { Interesting opening, in this game e4 was the first move. }) (1. c4 { This is the English Opening, good first move. In this game 1.e4 was played. }) 1-0

{ In Blitz the style of play can be different. Pins, forks, pawn chains and checks become more important, while accurate positioning can be less important (only among weak players not GMs of course). I hope this little guide helps you improve your blitz/bullet. 😊

Be aware that in order to really improve your chess skills slow time controls may be better. See Chapter 1 and 2. }

{ Start with e4! }
1. e4 { Good move! } { [%clk 0:45:00] } 1... c5 { Black plays the Sicilian, which move is very common for white now? } { [%clk 0:45:00] } 2. Nf3 { Correct! Going out with the knight! With the other knight it would be called the "Closed Sicilian" - I recommend the "Open Sicilian" } { [%csl Bc3,Gf3][%cal Bb1c3,Gg1f3] [%clk 0:44:45] } (2. Nc3 { Good move! This is the Closed Sicilian, but I would recommend another move. }) 2... Nc6 { Black goes with the "Old Sicilian" } { [%csl Gc6,Gc5] [%clk 0:44:31] } 3. c3 { I decided to play similar to the "Alapin Variation" - this makes even more sense to me now as it takes away squares for blacks knight } { [%csl Rd4,Rb4][%cal Rc6b4,Rc6d4] [%clk 0:44:30] } (3. Bb5 { This move is very common too, but I decided to do something different. Can you guess what? }) 3... d6 { This move is very passive, it allows us to gain control over the center! } { [%clk 0:43:55] } 4. d4 { Correct. d4 is a good move here! Can you see how white has two good bishops and more control over the center? } { [%csl Gd4,Ge4,Bc5][%cal Gf1a6,Gc1h6] [%clk 0:44:11] } 4... g6 { Black has the "Dragon-Variation" in mind, but in this case he oversees my central advantage. There are two good moves. } { [%clk 0:42:14] } 5. dxc5 { We win a pawn. If black recaptures we can take his queen and win some time. } { [%csl Bc5,Gd8][%cal Gd1d8,Bd6c5] [%clk 0:43:49] } (5. d5 { Yes this is a good move! I decided to take on c5 instead, because I like the idea of exchanging Queens in this game, because it gives me some time advantage. }) 5... dxc5 { So what should we play now? } { [%clk 0:40:53] } 6.

Nxd8 { How can we use the fact that blacks king is a little bit exposed? } { [%clk 0:40:41] } 7. Bb5+ { Right!

This is good for white! } { [%csl Gf1,Gg1,Gf2,Gg2,Gh2,Bd7] [%clk 0:41:56] } 9... Nc6 { Black needs another move to bring his knight back in the game. Continue developing pieces! } { [%clk 0:39:46] } 10.

Also I wonder where to put my other rook later... on the b-file or the c-file? } { [%csl Ra1] }) (10.

Na3 { Best move here, I decided to develop my bishop first. }) (10. Nbd2 { This way the bishop is blocked! } { [%csl Rd2][%cal Rc1d2] }) 10... Bg7 { Black doesn't play Bh6, but Bg7. Look at his bishop. Where is he planning to go from there? Maybe the idea is to push the e-pawn. } { [%csl Rc3,Rb2,Rd4,Re5][%cal Ge7e5] [%clk 0:38:14] } 11. Na3 { Good move! We develop another piece towards blacks exposed king! } { [%clk 0:40:33] } (11. Rd1+ { Good move, but I prefer to develop my minor pieces first. }) (11. Nbd2 { There is a better place for the knight! }) 11... a6 { Black makes a huge mistake, creating a hole in his pawn structure. We can use that! } { [%csl Rb5,Bb6][%cal Ba3c4,Bc4b6] [%clk 0:37:37] } 12. Nc4 { We threaten now blacks rook! } { [%csl Bd7,Ba8][%cal Bb6d7,Bb6a8,Rc4b6] [%clk 0:40:22] } 12...

I didn't see that black could trap my bishop. But luckily black played this very bad move: } { [%cal Ge4c5,Gc5e6,Ge6c7,Gg6g5,Gf5f4] [%clk 0:31:00] } (20. Nxc4 { Good move, but it doesn't trap the rook. }) 20... Na5 { White should take on c4 now, but I was to focused on my old plan (to win the rook).

This is the best move here. I missed that one! I continued to trap the rook instead. }) 21... Bh6 { Black realises the problem and responds by attacking our rook! What should we do? } { [%csl Rc1][%cal Rh6c1] [%clk 0:22:43] } 22. f4 { Yes now we simply block of the threat! Nothing can stop us! } { [%csl Gf4][%cal Gc7f4,Rh6f4] [%clk 0:27:29] } (22.

We move out of the dangerous diagonal and attack a pawn at the same time. } { [%csl Gf4][%cal Gf1f4,Gc7f4,Rh6c1] [%clk 0:26:22] } (25. Rd1 { Good positional play. I prefered to attack the double pawns instead. (Rf1) }) 25... Nc5+ { Black gives check. Where should we move the king? } { [%clk 0:15:17] } 26. Ke2 { Correct! } { [%clk 0:25:42] } 26... e5 { Think about the right move now. This is a tactical position. } { [%clk 0:14:42] } 27. b4 { Very good! We are threatening both knights! } { [%csl Rc5,Ra5][%cal Rb4c5,Rb4a5] [%clk 0:24:59] } (27. Bxe5 { This would be fatal! } { [%csl Re5][%cal Rh8e8,Re8e2] }) 27... Ne6 { What now? } { [%clk 0:13:58] } 28. Bxe5 { Right! We can take, because we are up material after taking blacks knight anyway so we can sacrifice our bishop in case of an attack. } { [%clk 0:24:38] } 28... Re8 { Black is planning to win the bishop. What now? } { [%csl Ge5][%cal Ge8e2] [%clk 0:13:50] } 29. bxa5 { Correct. This way we have enough compensation for the bishop. } { [%clk 0:24:21] } 29... Nc5 { Black attacks. What now? } { [%csl Re5][%cal Re8e5] [%clk 0:13:25] } 30. Nc4 { Correct. Why not guard it? } { [%clk 0:23:54] } 30... Bg7 { Black still wants our bishop really bad.

Rxc5 { Right. The knight wasn't defended. } { [%clk 0:21:06] } 34... Bh4 { Black uses his last chance and tries to checkmate us!!! How can we prevent that? } { [%csl Re1][%cal Rh4e1,Re8e1] [%clk 0:11:21] } 35. g3 { 1-0 Black resigns. } { [%clk 0:20:58] } (35.

BTW it is a fork AND a discovered check. Do you see how bad the move h3 was for white?
